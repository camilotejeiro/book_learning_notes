The Divided Mind: The Epidemic of Mindbody Disorders
====================================================

--- 
Chapter 1: What is Psychosomatic Medicine 
---

With mindbody disorders, a doctor cannot "cure" a patient. It is the suffering
patient who must come to understand his malady and by understanding it, it will
banish.

It is one thing to accept the concept that the mind has great power over the
body, but quite another to internalize that knowledge, and to understand it on a
deeply personal basis.

Psychosomatic disorders belong to a larger group of entities known as
psychogenic disorders, which can be defined as any physical disorders induced or
modified by the brain for psychological reasons. 		

Psychosomatic disorders: the brain induces actual physical changes in the body.

Tension myositis syndrome (TMS): a painful disorder, in this condition, the
brain orders a reduction of blood flow to a specific part of the body, resulting
in mild oxygen deprivation, which causes pain and other symptoms, depending on
what tissues have been oxygen deprived.

What is the genesis of a psychosomatic disorder? The cause is to be found in the
unconscious regions of the mind, and as we shall also see, its purpose is to
deliberately distract the conscious mind.

The type of symptom and its location in the body is not important so long as it
fulfills its purpose of diverting attention from what is transpiring in the
unconscious. On occasion, however, the choice of symptom location may even
contribute to the diversion process, something that is common with psychosomatic
disorders.

In my experience, the many structural abnormalities that are claimed to be the
basis for surgery are usually not responsible for the pain so that neither
surgical nor even conservative physical treatment of any kind is appropriate. I
have taken to advising my patients that the worst indication for musculoskeletal
surgery is pain attributed to some structural abnormality.

The mind's strategy is to distract attention from what is going on in the
unconscious mind and focus it on a body symptom. By so doing it perpetuates the
process.

The sad reality is that most of the people suffering from conditions like
chronic pain, fibromyalgia, and CTS will not accept a psychosomatic diagnosis. 

It is not known what determines the unconscious mind's choice of which system or
symptom to employ, but it makes no difference since the purpose of all symptoms
is the same -- to distract the conscious mind.

One is forced to the conclusion that psychosomatic reactions and, therefore, the
emotions that cause them, are universal. It is important to recognize that they
are not illnesses; they are a part of life, part of the human condition.

Bulimia, anorexia nervosa, and neurasthenia are quasi-physical equivalents of
TMS. Experience strongly suggests that anxiety, depression, and
obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), all purely emotional conditions, are
equivalents as well. 

Treating anxiety or depression with medications without in-depth psychotherapy
is poor medicine, and may even be dangerous if the symptom imperative leads to a
serious disorder like one of the many autoimmune maladies or cancers.

There is a stigma attached to disorders relating to psychology. Negative words
like weird, crazy, kooky,and nuts come to mind. Psychologists and psychiatrists
are head shrinkers or "shrinks." "It's all in your mind" is almost insulting,
implying there's something strange or weak about you or that the symptoms are in
your imagination. This is most unfortunate, since the symptoms are very real,
the result of a very physical process. 

Another factor negatively impacting mindbody medicine is that, as with the
stigma attached unfairly to cancer and tuberculosis patients in the early
twentieth century, there is shame associated with the idea that one may be
suffering from psychologically induced symptoms. This persists in many quarters
despite the fact that today's young, educated people are more accepting of the
need for psychological help than were earlier generations. 

People much prefer a diagnosis that suggests they can get better with a "quick
fix": an injection, a medication, a manipulation, even surgery. Many patients
come to see me only after they have tried all of the above. 

Since the mid-twentieth century the physical specialties of medicine have moved
increasingly farther away from the idea that the brain can bring about physical
alterations in the body and that psychosomatic disorders exist.

Doctors of all kinds now appear to be constitutionally incapable of attributing
physical symptoms to emotions. This is a dramatic change from medical attitudes
and practices in the first half of the twentieth century. 

Put bluntly, emotional factors should be studied as risk factors in many
life-threatening disorders, and they are not.

Treating depression with drugs alone, without psychotherapy, is not only poor
medicine, it is also dangerous. The symptom imperative tells us that taking away
a symptom by the use of a placebo or an antidepressant will only give rise to
another symptom, and the other symptom may be related to something serious, like
cancer. 

We all have a responsibility to create environments that interact benignly with
our genes.

Chemistry will correct the disorder. Such treatment may indeed modify the
symptoms, but that is not the same thing as curing the disorder.

Chapter 2: A Brief History of Psychosomatic Medicine 
---

If the psyche has induced a physical symptom (such as back pain) or an emotional
symptom (such as depression), which is then temporarily relieved in some fashion
without dealing with the underlying emotional dynamic, the psyche will simply
create another symptom to take its place. 

The TMS and the depression are not disorders in themselves; they are symptoms of
unconscious conflicts and must be treated with psychotherapy to avoid the
inevitable return of new symptoms.

Often, the "trauma" is both remote in time and of a minor nature, like a fall on
the ice and the subsequent onset of buttock pain months later.

More commonly, patients with TMS will develop symptoms in association with what
might be called perceived trauma, wherein pain comes on suddenly while the
person is engaged in some benign physical activity like lifting a suitcase or
swinging a tennis racquet. The activity is thought to be the cause of the pain,
while in fact it is merely a trigger for the onset of the psychosomatic TMS.

The concept that we humans have two minds is very important to understanding
TMS. It is clear that we are two different people -- one of them conscious and
the other unconscious.

The two men were puzzled, however, by the fact that an unconscious idea, though
not sufficiently intense to become conscious, could be strong enough to induce
motor paralysis. How could a weak idea produce such a strong effect? To answer
this, they suggested that the pleasure or displeasure that the idea provoked --
that is, the nature of its emotional content -- might determine whether or not
it could become conscious.

Psychogenic symptoms are meant to be protective distractions.

We have concluded that since everyone experiences psychosomatic symptoms, the
mind-split is a universal human trait, not something associated only with the
neuroses.

One thing is clear from reading Studies on Hysteria, and it is that Charcot,
Breuer, and Freud were the first to recognize that pain could be psychogenic,
that it could originate in the mind.

The idea of the split mind and of the conflict that exists between the more
intelligent, ethical, moral conscious mind and the childish, primitive
unconscious mind. 

The symptom imperative: the tendency for symptoms to shift to other locations
when they have been relieved legitimately or factitiously, as with a placebo.

They observed the clinical phenomenon whereby the psyche will often choose the
site of previous physical injury as the locus for symptoms. 

They reported the fact that a patient might have more than one set of
psychogenic symptoms simultaneously.

Psychogenic symptoms achieve their purpose by powerfully engaging the person's
attention.

They realized that the psyche represses undesirable emotions.

Virtually all of contemporary medicine, including most of psychiatry, denies
that the brain has the capacity to initiate physical, chemical, or neural
changes in the body. We are fully convinced that the brain has this power. This
concept is essential to understanding psychosomatic disorders.

Psychosomatic processes begin in the unconscious and, though it has yet to be
widely appreciated by either physical or psychiatric medicine, unconscious
emotions are a potent factor in virtually all physical ills.

Patients' physical symptoms were induced by the brain to serve a psychological
purpose, which is our definition of a psychosomatic disorder.

We are conscious of only a portion of our mental activities, and that much of
our thinking and feeling takes place totally outside of our awareness, in what
he called the unconscious.

Freud also defined three components of the human mind: the id, the ego, and the
superego. The id is the childish, self-centered, primitive part of the mind. One
might describe the ego as the captain, the chief executive, the decision maker
of the mind. Freud saw the superego as the moral, responsible, ethical element
of the psyche. 

The id can be seen as the evolutionary core of the individual, while the ego and
the superego represent later developments designed to enhance the chances of
survival. The nature of the id -- its power, its character, its emotional makeup
-- is central to any understanding of how mindbody medicine works. 

What is quite remarkable is that most modern humans are largely unaware of this
other self that exists in each of us and of the impact it has on every aspect of
our lives. It is not generally realized that intelligence is not everything,
that an intellectual genius may be an emotional baby or a monster. There is no
correlation between intelligence and emotional maturity or balance.

At a personal level there is a battle raging in the unconscious of every one of
us between the residual child-primitive that Freud called the id, and the
representatives of reason and morality he called the ego and the superego.

To adopt a popular mode of speaking, we might say that the ego stands for reason
and good sense while the id stands for untamed passions.

The conflict we are seeing in contemporary humans is a brainmind in transition,
not fully governed by intelligence, and still under the influence of primitive,
childish impulses, desires, and dicta. 

These negative attributes are what might be called the dregs of evolution, and
their social-political and medical reality is all around us.

This mental dichotomy is responsible not only for the common pain disorder I
have described in my books, but also a host of other medical disorders initiated
by similar psychic processes (gastroesophageal reflux, irritable bowel syndrome,
etc.). It is the basis for public health problems of enormous magnitude, but
these matters appear to be completely ignored by contemporary medicine.

Wishful impulses which have never passed beyond the id, but impressions, too,
which have been sunk into the id by repression, are virtually immortal; after
the passage of decades they behave as though they had just occurred. They can
only be recognized as belonging to the past. 

The -- immortal -- time factor is of great importance in understanding the
psychology of mindbody disorders.

Not only are repressed impressions and wishful impulses preserved without change
in the id, but so are any emotions generated in the unconscious. Hence,
unconscious anger generated in the mind of a boy often will be alive and equally
intense when he is forty as on the day it occurred. 

One of Freud's biographers, Peter Gay, describes the unconscious as a maximum
security prison where all the desperate criminals (i.e., dangerous feelings) are
kept under heavy lock and key. The analogy is helpful in understanding the
psychology of psychosomatic disorders, for it is the drive of these feelings to
come to consciousness (the attempt of criminals to escape) that necessitates
symptoms to prevent that from happening. 

We must rather attribute [to] the repressed [ideas] a strong upward drive, an
impulsion to break through into consciousness. The unconscious mind, it would
seem, wants to join the conscious mind. 

I could find no other way to explain the development of the symptoms in TMS
except to see them as a deliberate distraction designed to prevent the
dangerous, painful emotions of the unconscious from becoming part of conscious
experience.

Our studies of TMS lead us to conclude that repression serves a protective
purpose since the repressed emotions, should we become aware of them, would in
some way be dangerous to normal existence or be too emotionally painful to deal
with.

Freud described the id as the fundamental self, the bedrock person inside each
one of us, and the ego as a component that has come into being to protect it.

From a Darwinian perspective the ego evolved out of the id to save it from the
extinction suffered by less fortunate evolutionary cousins. One might say the
ego developed in response to the overarching evolutionary imperative: to
survive. 

The ego interprets the world for the id and protects it from that world. To
fulfill its function, it must be rational, logical, and aware of time.

Freud pictured the ego as being under siege from both the demands of the id and
the pressure of everyday life. He believed these combined pressures led
inevitably to anxiety in the ego. 

The mind has developed still another trait -- the superego -- that Freud viewed
in moral terms. As he saw it, the superego insists that you not only have to
survive, but you have to survive as a successful, achieving individual.

The superego's influence: you must not only be moral, you must be a saint. You
must be perfect and good. 

How does the id react to such imperatives? The pressures we put on ourselves,
and the workings of the superego, infuriate the id. All the narcissistic id
wants is to gratify its desires for comfort, pleasure, and dependency, but
instead it is being pressured to be a responsible adult. The result may be
emotional pain, sadness, anger, and, cumulatively, rage.

Because it is the educator and guardian of the self, one must conclude that it
is the ego, perhaps at the behest of the superego, that decides on the
protective strategy of repression, which is then reinforced by psychosomatic
symptoms. 

The ego is aware of dangerous goings-on in the unconscious and that these
feelings are striving to come to consciousness, so it takes steps, sometimes
quite dramatic steps to be sure, to see that the danger and emotional pain
remain contained.

My experience with TMS has convinced me that the purpose of this repression is
to protect the individual, to prevent the painful, dangerous feelings from
coming to consciousness and causing even greater distress. The psychosomatic
symptoms that accompany this repression, while sometimes extremely distressing,
are not some form of punishment but are generated to distract the conscious mind
and therefore to assist the process of repression.

Painful or otherwise distressing psychosomatic symptoms are designed for
self-preservation, not self-flagellation.

In my view, the repressed feelings are painful and dangerous rather than bad,
and the drive to repress them is motivated by the need to protect the total
individual.

The psychosomatic symptoms -- whether pain, discomfort, depression, or whatever
-- are activated solely to reinforce repression and protect the person from
mental pain or discomfort. 

What Freud called resistance is then seen as a response to great fear of those
repressed feelings and an unconscious unwillingness to experience them, not
because they are morally reprehensible, but because they are dangerous and
painful

The state of anxiety, which is perceived by the individual as a psychological
malaise, is a reaction to what is being repressed, created by the ego as a
distraction, much as it creates depression and physical pain for the same
purpose.

Anxiety is an equivalent of pain and depression. It, too, acts to assist
repression. 

What the patient fears is not an external but an internal situation of malaise
and danger -- painful feelings and rage. The patient is not conscious of these
feelings. The anxiety is free floating, generalized to all aspects of the
person's life. Pain and depression may alternate with anxiety, making it quite
clear that they serve the same psychological purpose. 

Pain, anxiety, and depression are not symptomatic of illness or disease. They
are all part of the normal reaction to frightening unconscious phenomena.

Psychosomatic symptoms serve a protective rather than a punishing purpose.

What is genetically built in are the functional components of the mind -- the
id, the ego, and the superego, developed over eons by evolution -- and the
myriad manifestations of this mind, both good and bad.

The psyche could induce physical symptoms by initiating physiological pathology. 

The heart of the psychosomatic process is to keep painful and dangerous emotions
repressed and hidden in the unconscious, because these are emotions that would
wreak havoc were they allowed to become conscious. The unconscious is a domain,
a realm that is home to a variety of concepts, thoughts, ideas, feelings,
traits, and tendencies. Some are positive, pleasant, and socially acceptable (as
opposed to antisocial) and some are negative (e.g., feelings of inferiority).
Some are violent, some obscene, some childish (e.g., narcissism and dependency),
some dangerous and threatening (e.g., rage), and some are simply too painful and
sad to be consciously experienced. 

Our experience with thousands of TMS patients leads us to find that the mind
considers that the greater evil would be the conscious experience of emotional
pain and rage.

Another interpretation is that conscious feelings of worthlessness stimulate the
drive to be perfect and good that, in turn, stimulates unconscious rage,
resulting in a neurotic state. 

Symptoms may be created by autonomic activity (e.g., in the circulatory system)
or by the endocrine network. The basis for migraine headache, "habitual"
headache, and trigeminal neuralgia is rage. 

The brain has the capacity to induce physical symptoms like pain, cough, or
gastrointestinal disturbances, when motivated by psychic phenomena. 

Feelings of inferiority stimulate the drive for superiority and perfection. 

Unconscious feelings of inferiority are universal.

Psychogenic symptoms are defenses designed to protect one's self-esteem from the
pressures of life. 

Sensitivity to criticism is prominent in patients with low self-esteem. 

Alexander believed that emotions played a role in all illness, even in those
cases where they were not necessarily the cause of the illness. And he insisted
that it was as important to identify with precision the emotional components of
a disorder (e.g., cardiac) as the physiological ones. 

Alexander anticipated the current preoccupation with chemical psychiatry, and
warned, "A biochemical formula describing a receptive longing somewhere in the
cortex will never account for the interpersonal circumstances under which this
longing arose or became intensified." In other words, a symptom and its cause
can be very different things.

It is naive to think that linking a brain chemical to a behavioral state
establishes the cause of that state. Alleviating depression with a powerful drug
does not eliminate the reason for depression; it merely treats the symptom.

Our work with patients with TMS consistently demonstrates that the pain problem
is psychological, not physical. 

I strongly believe CFS to be a psychosomatic disorder, and this belief is
supported by my success in treating a very large number of cases. A further
indication that we are right is that many people suffering from CFS have
recovered from it simply by studying one of my books.

The term repressed rage was used by many authors describing patients with
hypertension and migraine. Alexander was particularly impressed by the rage
factor in migraine, noting that he had observed the immediate cessation of
headache as soon as his patient discharged his rage with a sharp verbal outburst
of vulgarity.

Others at the time reported that migraine patients tended to be perfectionistic,
ambitious, competitive, rigid, and unable to delegate responsibility.

Our own studies support their findings that the twin characteristics of
perfectionism and goodism are major factors in the genesis of TMS and its
equivalents, and that those same characteristics are enraging to something in
the unconscious. 

It should be noted that hostility, aggression, and rage are not synonymous.
Hostility and aggression are observable and are the consequences of unconscious
rage. They are not built in. Another misconception is that rage is always
conscious and suppressed. Rage may be overt, it may be conscious and suppressed,
or it may be unconscious and repressed, completely outside of the person's
awareness. In the case of unconscious rage, it is likely that it is not a
response to hostile-aggressive needs but a reaction to pressures imposed upon
the individual by the vicissitudes of life or, even more enraging, by the person
himself.

To my knowledge, most rheumatologists continue to treat RA with medications and
make no attempt to address emotional issues.

He refers to studies which found that the disorder occurred primarily in women
who, as adolescents, had a predilection for outdoor activities and competitive
sports and who, as adults, suppressed all emotional expression and had a
compulsion to strongly control their environment, including the lives of their
husbands and children. At the same time they were extremely caring and
protective of their families and exhibited such a powerful need to care for
others that Alexander characterized it as masochistic. Sexually, they seemed to
reject the feminine role and tended to select passive, compliant men as
husbands.

The general psychodynamic background in all cases is a chronic inhibited
aggressive state, a rebellion against any form of outside or inside pressure,
against being controlled by other persons or against the inhibitory influence of
their own hypersensitive consciences.

The sources of the rage are the outside and inside pressures (the perfect word),
the threat of control by others and the pressures brought to bear by their own
superegos. I could not have composed a more succinct statement.

Anyone studying psychosomatic disorders is bound to be impressed by the powerful
influence of childhood experiences.

Deep-seated rage somehow plays an important role in the genesis of the disorder,
although it is still to be determined how this emotion stimulates the production
of the rheumatoid factor and why the psyche chooses this rather than some other
physical manifestation. 

The accuracy of his diagnosis was confirmed in many cases by the patients'
prompt return to normal when the psychology behind the symptoms was identified.

Walters identified three types of psychogenic pain: psychogenic magnification of
physical pain; psychogenic muscular pain (tension headache, "fibrositis,"
spastic colon); and PRP, which he defined as pain for which no local reason
could be detected but which was clearly psychological in its evocation.

Psychosomatic phenomena are not a form of illness. They must be seen as part of
the human condition -- to which everyone is susceptible. They include a wide
range of disorders, some very serious and even life threatening, but our view is
that they may all be traced back to the primeval conflict between our two minds,
the unconscious and the conscious, the id and the ego and superego, the ancient
"paleomammalian mind" and the modern "neomammalian mind," each mind reacting in
the only way it knows to the pressures of daily life.

Chapter 3:The Psychology of Psychosomatic Disorders 
---

Every working day, at our clinic in the Rusk Institute of Rehabilitation
Medicine at the NYU Medical Center, we have the opportunity to see and study how
childhood experiences and the child in all of us -- the timeless, primitive,
unconscious mind that operates totally beyond our conscious awareness --
continues to influence, and even shape, our adult selves. 

The person agonized over the severity of the pain, recalling the things he had
read in my book about the psychological basis for it. Then, out of the blue, he
found himself saying something like, "I don't want that job of mine. It's too
hard, and there's too much responsibility. I want a job where somebody will tell
me what to do."

The ego is aware of the rage, emotional pain, and sadness and concludes it must
do something to prevent the explosion of the rage into the consciousness and
keep the person from experiencing the pain and sadness. And what does it do? It
creates pain as a distraction because it knows that will prevent the rage from
coming out and spare the individual from feeling the pain and sadness.

The fact that a psychosomatic symptom cannot be measured with the same precision
as fever does not mean it is not real. Its existence, as in the case of the
young engineer, is objectively evident.

It was Stanley J. Coen, of the Columbia University College of Physicians and
Surgeons, who first suggested that psychosomatic physical symptoms were in all
likelihood a defense against noxious unconscious emotional phenomena.

The patient's pain was a reaction to an unconscious emotion -- rage -- and its
purpose was to assist repression and make certain that the rage did not reach
consciousness. 

Psychosomatic symptoms are created to assist the repression of rage and other
unacceptable feelings. Although it is not entirely clear why these unconscious
feelings strive to become conscious, it is abundantly clear why the brain
resists the attempt: some of those feelings are believed to be too dangerous or
embarrassing or otherwise unacceptable to be brought into the light of day,
while others are simply too painful to be experienced consciously. 

The rage I'm talking about here is an accumulation of anger generated daily over
many years and kept repressed for the reason given above. The decision maker in
the brain has decided that the overt expression of unbridled rage would ruin the
person's life, and to prevent that from happening, it automatically initiates
physical symptoms in the body without consulting the conscious, rational mind. 

The unconscious rage under discussion must not be confused with conscious anger
or rage. While such overt emotions often reflect unconscious rage, they are not
the same thing and they are not stimulated by the same phenomena. They are
called displacements by psychologists.

It has been observed in many patients that when conscious anger is suppressed it
will become part of the reservoir of rage in the unconscious.

Does this mean that conscious anger can never be suppressed? Since there are
situations that demand suppression (work, family, etc.), one can avoid the
negative consequences of suppression by being aware that the anger will not
simply go away but will add to the unconscious rage reservoir inside. This
demonstrates just how important it is to be aware of your inner rage. 

While the repression of rage protects us from danger, the repression of other
intense, bad feelings protects us from feeling emotional pain. 

The symptoms created by the brain-mind, which we deplore as evils, are in fact
generated for our protection. 

One of my patients told me, "I think of TMS as a gift." He meant it revealed the
true cause of his pain, and it taught him things about himself and his feelings
that he would not have known otherwise.

But why should the symptoms take the form of pain, or stomach trouble or an
intractable rash or severe allergies, or, for that matter, anxiety or
depression? It would appear that all such disorders are meant to distract, to
keep one's attention focused on the physical, on the body. Even anxiety and
depression, clearly psychological phenomena, are states of discomfort that serve
just as well as physical symptoms to distract us from what the brain-mind
considers more dangerous or problematic phenomena. The more intense or
threatening the unconscious feelings are, the more severe the psychosomatic
reaction is likely to be. 

The child growing up in the modern world, regardless of socioeconomic status,
may be the victim of emotional, physical, or sexual abuse, all unconsciously
enraging. The abused child may feel sad, unhappy, or scared, but anger is
forbidden -- that prohibition is built in. But it is there, in the unconscious,
and it stays there. It accumulates and it is permanent because there is no sense
of time in the unconscious.

The developing child needs warmth, approval, role models, and guidance. We are
beginning to see more of this nurturing capacity in contemporary generations of
parents, but it appears that social patterns of the past were often neglectful
or hurtful to the developing child, wounding the child's self-regard, with all
the ramifications of low self self-esteem, and thus creating emotional needs
that persist through life. 

We yearn for that which we did not get as children and are permanently sad,
hurt, and angry as a consequence, but all in the unconscious. This is the stuff
of which psychosomatic symptoms are made.

When the hurt is gross, as with sexual abuse, it may be the major contributor to
the unconscious rage and emotional pain.

Feelings of inferiority are universal, varying in degree and intensity, but not
limited to "neurotics." The sense of inferiority appears to be the primary spur
to the drives to be perfect and good that is exceedingly common in patients
suffering with TMS. 

It must be that we are unconsciously trying to prove to ourselves and the world
that we are worthwhile, not inferior.

Feelings of inferiority are of immense importance if one is to understand the
psychosomatic phenomena they generate. The drive to superiority (perfection) is
a pressure.

The anatomical persistence of the "old brain" described there and all the
behavioral characteristics that are, so to speak, contained in it, is of immense
importance not only socially, politically, and medically but psychologically as
well. It is the part of the brain whose inclinations are in direct conflict
with the more responsible, intelligent, moral propensities of the "new brain."

The child-primitive is totally narcissistic, irresponsible, and dependent. It
harbors the seeds of violence, lust, and obscene behavior and reacts to the
pressures of the responsible mind with anger. It cannot stand the pressures to
be good, or perfect, or to take care of others, no matter how emotionally close
to those others they might be.

For many years we were aware of a consistent connection between the
perfectionist tendency and the development of TMS. 

It was a long time before I realized that the drive to be good could be equally
enraging to the child-primitive. It is yet another pressure. Though both the
perfect and the good tendencies are present in most patients I see, the good is
often the predominant one. These people are aware that they have a great need to
be liked and so find themselves looking for approval in everything they do and
going out of their way to be helpful, often at the expense of their own comfort
and convenience. If you speak to someone who is an inveterate caretaker, helper,
do-gooder, you are impressed by the power of the compulsion that drives them.
Typically, they avoid confrontation.

These tendencies, like so many aspects of the psychosomatic process, seem to be
almost universal.

The psychosomatic reactions they are experiencing are both normal and universal.

The drive to be perfect and good are reactions to feelings of inferiority, which
are always unconscious (and sometimes conscious as well). Such tendencies to
achieve and be nice are typical of people trying to demonstrate by their
performance and behavior that they are worthwhile, not inferior. Statistically,
these tendencies are among the most important contributors to the reservoir of
rage that is a primary factor in the genesis of psychosomatic symptoms. 

In a survey of 104 of my TMS patients, I found that the perfect-good drive was
either the predominant factor, or a very significant factor in 94 percent of the
cases. 

* In 31.5 percent of the patients studied, the perfect-good tendency was the
* primary contributor to the TMS rage, and that childhood abuse and life
* pressures were less important

* In 36.5 percent of the cases, the perfect-good drive and life pressures
* appeared to be equally significant contributors

* In 17 percent, the perfect-good drive and childhood abuse were the most
* important

* In 8 percent, all three factors ( perfect-good drive, life pressures, and
* childhood abuse ) were equally important. 

* In 3.5 percent, child abuse was the primary contributor. 

* In 2.5 percent, life pressures were the most important contributor.

Striving to be good is not a sickness, and statistics like these make it clear
that psychosomatic disorders and the psychology that prompts them are not
pathological or "neurotic" but an integral part of normal living. Yet mainstream
medicine continues to consider them pathological for the same old reason --
because they have been misdiagnosed as due to structural or soft tissue
pathology.

When viewed properly, they are clearly part of normal human experience. You can
study the anatomy, physiology, and chemistry of the brain forever and a day, but
it will teach you nothing about psychosomatic phenomena, nor about emotional
disorders like depression for that matter. This is because the deviations from
the normal that are featured in such studies are not the cause of the disorders
but rather the result of the emotional phenomena that stimulated those
deviations in the first place.

It is emotions that drive the chemistry in the brain, not the other way around.
Altered serotonin chemistry is not a disorder, it is an emotionally induced
chemical reaction resulting from the true symptom, which is depression.

We are much further along now in understanding why the highachieving young
engineer developed TMS. He had pushed himself unmercifully, and his
child-primitive reacted with rage. From there on, the sequence of events was
inevitable -- his decision-making ego had to instigate TMS or one of its
equivalents to make sure that the rage did not erupt into his conscious life.
The fascinating thing in his case was that despite the ego's efforts, the
child-primitive mind managed to make itself heard. "I don't want that job -- I
want a job where someone will tell me what to do."

The child-primitive is under pressure not only from our self-imposed drives to
be perfect and good, but from the many things going on in our outside lives: our
work, career, family (both immediate and extended), finances, illness, aging,
and mortality, just to note the most important. These pressures are easier to
understand than the self-imposed ones because they can be observed objectively.

Taken together they contribute significantly to the reservoir of rage we all
have.

Traditionally, these environmental pressures have been referred to as stressors.
We prefer to call them pressures because that term includes things not generally
thought of as stressors, like being a good wife or husband, or a good parent, or
a good son or daughter to one's parents, and because it also carries the idea
that something in the psyche is being pressured, an idea that is essential to
the concepts advanced here.

Financial problems and illnesses are obvious examples of life pressures and need
no further explanation.

There are all sorts of pressure in the workplace, many quite obvious but some
harder to spot. They are consciously disturbing and unconsciously enraging. 

what about getting old and dying? We tend to rationalize. After all, dying is
part of life, it's inevitable, and one must accept it with good grace. But it is
a very different story with the child-primitive in the unconscious. That
narcissistic part of our emotional makeup is in a rage at the idea of having to
put up with illness, perhaps disability, and the ultimate insult to the
individual -- death. These feelings, though unconscious, are as real as the ones
of which we are conscious.

Mainstream medicine is aware that emotions can worsen an existing disease
process, but it appears to be unable to understand or 

Accept the idea that symptoms can be initiated in response to emotional states.
The altered physiology and chemistry that produce these symptoms, whether
physical or affective, are induced by unconscious emotions. Thirty years working
with mindbody disorders -- TMS and a host of others -- clearly support this. 

The terrifying events of September 11, 2001, resulted in a dramatic increase in
psychosomatic reactions across the United States, as might have been expected.
The majority of us were frightened, but fright doesn't create psychosomatic
symptoms. The reaction to conscious fear is to try to overcome its source, to
deny or to rationalize it. But we are unaware of our unconscious fear and the
feelings it engenders, feeding our reservoir of emotional pain to such an extent
that new symptoms are bound to occur. 

If, as Freud theorized, psychosomatic symptoms were meant to be punishment, why
would we need to be punished for being afraid? There would be no reason. But if,
on the other hand, symptoms are designed to protect us from experiencing painful
and dangerous emotions, as we have shown, then our reactions to the terrorist
attacks on New York and Washington are logical -- the increased bad feelings had
to be contained in the unconscious, hence the need for symptoms. The fear of
death and disability, noted above as a life pressure, was certainly enhanced in
many people that tragic day. 

Guilt and shame are intolerable to the child-primitive and evoke anger,
emotional pain and sadness, and there is no dearth of those emotions among all
of us.

Those of us who are prone to psychosomatic manifestations usually have a strong
need to be in complete control of our environments.

Generally, people find it difficult to conceptualize the idea of unconscious
rage. Some find it abhorrent, while others simply can't believe it can be there
inside them without their knowledge. They think anger and rage are such strong
emotions that one must be aware of them. The idea that emotions -- raw, heated,
towering emotions -- can exist outside of consciousness is hard to accept. Even
when people intellectually acknowledge that these might exist, they find it hard
to imagine them because they don't feel them.

We live in the world of the conscious, and most of us think it is our only
world. We acknowledge only what we are aware of, what we feel consciously.
People exhibiting psychosomatic symptoms have to make an effort to imagine
painful or threatening internal feelings and, equally important, reflect on the
magnitude of their feelings and their potential for doing great harm. One must
learn to think of these unconscious feelings in volcanic terms and understand
that their intensity has the potential to wreak havoc in our lives or would
simply be too painful to bear. 

That is how the decision maker in our brains -- the ego -- must conceive of the
situation, for it stimulates the production of physical or affective symptoms
automatically, without seeking the approval of the thinking mind. The process
totally bypasses the intellect. It is clearly a subcortical reaction, for logic
suggests that if reason were permitted to participate in the decision it would
likely say, "This is ridiculous. I'd rather deal with the scary feelings than
suffer the pain." 

The psychosomatic process does not allow us a choice. The threat to the ego must
seem mortal, and the intellect is not permitted to participate in the decision.
It is bypassed. The ego acts decisively and swiftly, and induces symptoms. 

It's funny, but when I feel anxious I have no pain. It serves the same purpose.

He was a mild-mannered man, always in complete control of his emotions, but
someone who felt things very deeply.

Our experience suggests that unconscious rage rather than stress is the active
psychological ingredient leading to many serious disorders.

My experience in treating these cases strongly suggests that psychosomatic
symptoms are meant to distract, and to protect the conscious mind from dangerous
emotions, and we conclude that the need for new symptoms is to guarantee that
the protective mission will continue.

Many of my patients become permanently symptom free simply by coming to
understand the nature of the psychosomatic process.

The accumulated rage in his unconscious became threatening in its intensity and
the result was physical symptoms in the form of pain in the lower back and leg.

The symptom imperative at work. When he learned to curb his temper, the back
pains began. Psychic and physical symptoms are interchangeable, both serving the
same psychological purpose. 

Knowledge of the intricacies and intrigues of the unconscious is Freud's gift to
us. But he underestimated the mind's power by failing to recognize that it could
achieve its ends by altering physiology through manipulation of the autonomic,
immune, and neuroendocrine systems. Years of work with patients suffering from
TMS and its equivalents provide abundant evidence of this power.

Who we are and what our lives consist of are the most common causes of
psychosomatic symptoms. 

Displaced anger, consciously experienced, is common when there is significant
unconscious rage. It is a safe substitute for expressing the forbidden rage
inside. This is undoubtedly the mechanism behind phenomena like road rage. 

The practice of psychosomatic medicine identifies a whole new population of
people needing psychotherapy, most of whom would never have realized the need
but for the pain.

Because almost the entire medical community lacks an awareness of the existence
of psychosomatic phenomena, doctors have largely become mere technicians to a
body rather than physicians to a person.

We possess ideas, but we are possessed by feelings. They lie too deep for
understanding, astir with their own secret life and carrying us with them.

The well-controlled man remains calm and copes well under extreme stress, but
beyond his awareness the pressure induces unlimited fury in the unconscious.
That idea would embarrass him if he knew about it, and when such a possibility
is suggested, he denies it vehemently. Almost always, neither doctor nor patient
is aware that self-imposed pressure, which is characteristic of ambitious,
accomplished men is possibly more enraging internally than the external pressure
we call "stress."

Coronary arteriosclerosis is linked to emotional factors.

Whereas Freud viewed the suffering of the neurotic, whether psychologically or
physically, as punishment, it is now clear that the symptoms are serving to
protect the individual rather than hurt him or her by allowing unwelcome
feelings to escape into consciousness.

To remind ourselves again, the psyche views the physical symptom as the lesser
of two evils. Better to suffer pain than to have one's life ruined by the
manifestations of unbridled rage or intensely painful feelings.

Viewed from the standpoint of the brain's strategy, one must conclude that the
drive to produce symptoms to divert attention from unconscious feelings is so
compelling that the brain will stoop to trickery. It will often initiate
symptoms in association with essentially benign physical maneuvers, things that
the person has done thousands of times before without ill affect, so that the
patient will conclude that the physical act initiated the pain. Despite the lack
of logic, people are very prone to make such assumptions.

The brain practices many similar deceits. Following a legitimate injury, such as
a sprained ankle, the brain will sometimes continue generating the pain in the
form of TMS long after healing has occurred. It will often locate pain at the
site of an old injury, such as a previous fracture, for example. If it knows
that there is a disk abnormality, it will initiate pain somewhere in the
vicinity of the disk bulge or protrusion. It usually does so in a somewhat
inefficient way so that the diagnostician can discern that the abnormality does
not explain the location of the patient's symptoms. This is very common.

Clearly, the brain considers unconscious feelings to be infinitely more
dangerous or painful than pain, or why would it practice so sedulously to
deceive?

One of the prime characteristics of TMS is that the pattern of symptoms will
develop as a result of Pavlovian conditioning. People will experience the kind
of symptoms they have learned to expect to experience, just as Pavlov's dogs
learned to associate the presentation of food with the ringing of a bell. 

Experience with large numbers of patients at our clinic makes it clear that
these are programmed responses that bear no relationship to anything beyond what
the patient is conditioned to expect. That's why the most common psychosomatic
disorders are invariably the ones currently in vogue.

Today, virtually no one in medicine, including many psychiatrists, believes
psychosomatic processes even exist. As a result, epidemics of pain, depression,
and lifethreatening conditions flourish throughout the industrialized world.

Chapter 4: Treatment 
---

"What you need in order to get better, my friend," I said, "is not a leap of
faith but a leap of understanding." 

That is the heart of treating psychosomatic disorders.

successful treatment depends on an accurate diagnosis. My colleagues and I have
been successful because we have made the right diagnosis, not because we have
found the right treatment. We do not have an "approach" to the problems of acute
and chronic pain -- we have the diagnosis. 

The treatment that emerges with any malady is a natural consequence of the
nature of the disorder. So it has been with TMS and other psychosomatic
disorders. 

It soon became evident that knowledge was the key to treating TMS. Whatever else
might be necessary to effect total resolution of the patient's problem --
psychotherapy, for example -- people needed to know about the anatomy,
physiology, and psychology of TMS and how these were related.

Another crucial therapeutic element became clear early on as well: the person
must not only understand the nature of the process but be able to fully accept
it as well. Not faith, but acceptance of the idea is essential. Blind faith
leads to a placebo cure, if any. By contrast, acceptance and acknowledgment
produce permanent results. 

Failure of acceptance is an impediment to "cure" for some patients because
inability to accept the concepts of TMS is one of the psyche's strategies for
maintaining the process.

In addition to creating pain, the psyche creates doubt -- the better to keep the
syndrome going. 

The fact that my books can "cure" is convincing evidence that our therapeutic
program is not a placebo. There is no treatment, no charismatic personal
influence -- only the acquisition of information, which cannot in any way be
construed as a placebo treatment. Blind faith is not involved and the result is
permanent, which is not at all characteristic of the placebo effect. 

Overly conscientious, exceedingly responsible, compulsive, my need to have the
behavior of others conform to my own narrowly defined standards, and above all
else, my uncompromising perfectionism, are all self-pressures and TMS factors.

Return of symptoms or symptom substitution is the rule because of the symptom
imperative.

The patient's education begins during the physical examination.

knowledge of the disorder is essential to successful treatment.

The lecture's therapeutic power is firmly based on the information transmitted.
We know this from patient reactions during the lecture and from the fact that it
is often followed fairly quickly by pain relief

The inconsistencies of a structural diagnosis

Experience has made it clear that knowledge is the ultimate component for
recovery from TMS

In order to get the brain to stop the psychosomatic process, they must: 

* Repudiate the physical-structural explanation for the pain and attribute it
* instead to the benign altered physiology, the physical-emotional basis of TMS 

* Recognize that the pain is a reaction to a psychological state and that the
* tendency to have the physical reactions of TMS and its equivalents is
* universal and a normal component of everyday life 

It is essential to establish the fact that nothing will change symptomatically
unless those two conditions are met.

The purpose of symptoms is to divert attention from unconscious emotional
phenomena. If patients denigrate the physical symptom and focus instead on
things psychological, they have effectively undermined the unconscious brain's
strategy.

The acquired information apparently induces a positive reaction in the
unconscious since the unconsciously generated symptoms cease. 

Although pain and neurological symptoms like numbness, tingling, and even
weakness are common and sometimes severe, the mild oxygen deprivation
responsible for them is benign and does not cause damage to the muscles, nerves,
or tendons that may be involved, and the symptoms are transient. This is
important since patients almost invariably have been misinformed and frightened
by their advisors, medical and nonmedical, whose advice tends to worsen the
symptoms.

Patients need to know that TMS, though it is currently the most common of a
large group of psychosomatic disorders, is not unique.

It has become clear that these patterns are programmed a la Pavlov for they
disappear promptly with treatment, which would not be the case if they were due
to a structural abnormality. 

Fear plays an important role in the perpetuation and intensification of the
symptoms.

While all the subjects included in the lecture are covered in my three books,
presenting them verbally has a greater impact than the written word.

Patients have been frightened by words like degeneration, disintegration, and
herniation, used to describe their structural abnormalities; they have become
fearful of physical activity and warned against assuming certain postures

If pain has been persistent, they fear the consequences of continuing pain and
disability, worry about their work and responsibilities, and so on. The
deleterious influence of fear needs no explanation. Patients need to be
reassured that they have been misinformed and that they are experiencing an
essentially benign disorder. 

we focus on the unconscious rage, emotional pain, and sadness that are directly
responsible for the physical symptoms. I emphasize that it serves little purpose
to concentrate solely on the rage itself, since except under extremely unusual
circumstances it will not be expressed consciously. I tell the patients that
they must, instead, pay attention to the four sources of the rage and emotional
reactions: 

* Anger, emotional pain, and sadness that can be traced back to childhood 

* Anger stemming from the self-imposed pressures to be perfect and good 

* Anger generated from the pressures of life 

* Miscellaneous things like guilt, shame, fear, insecurity, and vulnerability
* that also feed the reservoir of rage 

Though it is likely that the major purpose of the pain is to prevent the escape
of rage into consciousness, we emphasize that the psyche is also desirous of
preventing the person from feeling the emotional pain and sadness 

Throughout the discussion of the sources of rage, patients are reminded of the
great difference that exists between the conscious and unconscious reactions to
life, differences that are reflected in the title of this book. We humans are
anatomically and behaviorally two different people, in constant conflict.

It is TMS and there was no cause for concern.

What is crystal clear is the role of pain and other symptoms in psychosomatic
disorders. It is there to prevent feelings from coming out.

The rule: your rage will not come out. The exception: it may if the provocation
is great enough. 

there is a sine qua non of "cure": 

* That there be little (not functionally significant) or no pain 

* That there be no physical restrictions and no fear of physical activity 

* That all physical treatments must be discontinued

With respect to physical activity, while some of our patients never cease being
physically active, the majority are intimidated by their pain and are fearful of
most physical activities. This fear must be overcome, and I tell them that for
years we have been advising our patients to engage in unrestricted physical
activities when the pain is gone and that there has never been a report of
physical trouble as a consequence. Many patients report prompt disappearance of
pain, but a lot of them admit that it was months before they were able to screw
up the courage to return to their previous level of physical activity

### Daily Study Program

The principle behind getting better is to understand what tension myositis
syndrome (TMS) is all about and to acknowledge that TMS, and nothing else, is
the cause of your pain or numbness, tingling or weakness, regardless of where
you are feeling these things. 

Concentrate on understanding TMS. You have a normal back or neck or leg or arm!
Your symptoms are all due to mild oxygen deprivation, which is harmless but can
cause very severe symptoms. When and where you have the pain is not important.
You are going to change your brain's program by thinking about certain things
every day until the pain stops.

In order to get better it is essential that you put your past medical
experiences behind you and concentrate on this program.

Here is the program I want you to follow: 

If you have not already done so, read the entire book you are using a bit at a
time (Healing Back Pain or The Mindbody Prescription). After that, read the
psychology or treatment chapter every day. Pay close attention to what you read,
especially when you see things that remind you of yourself.

Set aside time every day, possibly fifteen minutes in the morning and thirty
minutes in the evening, to review the material.

Unconscious painful and threatening feelings are what necessitates the pain.
They are inside you; you don't feel them.

Make a list of all the things that may be contributing to those feelings. 

Write an essay, the longer the better, about each item on your list. This will
force you to focus in depth on the emotional things of importance in your life.
There are a number of possible sources of those feelings:

Anger, hurt, emotional pain, and sadness generated in childhood will stay with
you all your life because there is no such thing as time in the unconscious. 

Feelings experienced in the unconscious at any time in a person's life,
including childhood, are permanent. Physical, sexual, or emotional abuse will
leave large amounts of pain and sadness. But not receiving adequate emotional
support, enough warmth and love will also result in anger, sorrow, and pain,
maybe never felt as a child, but always there in the unconscious. Such things as
excessive discipline or unreasonable expectations will also leave emotional
marks. Anything that prevents a child from being a child falls into this
category and should be put on your list. 

In most people with TMS, certain personality traits make the greatest
contribution to the internal emotional pain and anger. Put these at the head of
your list. If you expect a great deal of yourself, if you drive yourself to be
perfect, to achieve, to succeed, if you are your own severest critic, if you are
very conscientious, these are likely to make you very angry inside. Sensitivity
to criticism and deep-down feelings of inferiority are common and also
contribute to inner anger. In fact, feelings of inferiority may be the major
reason we strive to be perfect and good. 

If you have a strong need to please people, to want them to like you, or if you
tend to be very helpful to everyone and anyone, if you are the caretaker type
and are always worrying about your family, friends, and relatives, these drives
will also make you furious inside, because that's the way the mind works. The
child in our unconscious doesn't care about anyone but itself and gets angry at
the pressures to be perfect and good.

Just as the inner mind reacts against being perfect or good, it also resents any
kind of life pressure. So you should put on your list anything in your life that
represents pressure or responsibility, like your job; your spouse, if you are
married; your children, if you are a parent; your parents, if they are living;
and, of course, any big problems that are going on in your life. 

A subtle but important source of inner anger in some people is the fact that
they are getting old and also that they are mortal. This is more common than you
would think. Consciously, we rationalize; unconsciously, we are enraged. Close
personal relationships, no matter how good they are, are often the source of
unconscious anger, because it's very hard to be consciously angry at a parent, a
spouse, or a child. 

Add to your list those situations in which you become consciously angry (or
annoyed) but cannot express it, whatever the reason may be. That suppressed
anger is internalized and becomes part of the reservoir of rage that brings on
TMS. The angers we talked about above are repressed -- you don't feel them, you
don't know they are there. 

Do not be alarmed. Everybody is under pressure from themselves or from life
circumstances -- and everybody has some degree of rage in their unconscious.
This program is designed to stop the brain from producing pain because it fears
that the rage, emotional pain, or sadness will manifest itself and be felt
consciously if it doesn't do something to distract you. You must sit down and
think about these things every day. This is the way the ideas get from your
conscious mind to your unconscious mind. That's where they have to get to in
order for the brain to stop the pain process

When the pain is gone, or almost gone, start to do physical things you have been
afraid to do. This is very difficult for some people with TMS, and it may take
many weeks or months before you are able to get back to full physical activity.
But that must be your goal in order to convince your mind that you know you have
a normal back (or neck or shoulder or wherever the pain is).

Don 't give up. You have to put in time and effort to make this work. 

There is no uniform pattern of improvement. In some, it is in fits and starts;
in others, it is gradual and may extend over weeks and even months.

Many patients ask what to do or say to stop the pain immediately, and it is
pointed out that the thrust of the program is to bring about a change in their
understanding of the entire process, making it an exercise in preventive
medicine rather than a method of bringing immediate relief. Once having achieved
this reorganization of thought, however, one can often abort an incipient attack
of pain by rehearsing in the mind the pertinent psychological factors in one's
case or even "talking to your brain."

Try hard not to pay attention to your pain. When you find yourself thinking
about it, force yourself to think about the psychological things on your list. 

Patients are advised to work on the program daily for three to four weeks and
then call me.

Why is Knowledge Curative?

It is obvious that the educational process effects a "cure." For patients with
mild symptoms, the mere knowledge that the symptoms are psychosomatic, without
further psychological insight, is curative in and of itself and undoubtedly
explains many of the book "cures." 

"I can use my imagination and think of my unconscious as the basement of my
mind. I know what's down there even though I can't see or hear it. I have been
taught to recognize the inhabitants of my unconscious mind, in all of their
dangerous, unflattering detail."

Thus successful therapy is not the result of better repression by a so-called
strengthened ego. Rather, it is the outcome of an insightful reorganization of
their thinking, which must then lead to a reorganization of what is going on in
the unconscious to the extent that the psyche is no longer threatened by the
rage to the same degree it was prior to the teaching. 

Knowledge, awareness, and insight have been the cornerstones of analytically
oriented psychotherapy since Freud, so it should come as no surprise that they
are the keys to treating psychosomatic disorders.

The magnitude of the threat characterized the old organization; the educational
process has diminished the threat.

Since psychosomatic disorders are the result of unconscious processes and
conflicts, our psychological program has focused on the use of short-term
dynamic psychotherapy as the best means to deal with underlying stress and
emotional conflict.

Emotional repression and the mechanisms by which this leads to physical
symptoms. 

All our psychotherapy is administered within the same framework. Whether a
patient is in group or individual psychotherapy, the therapist's job is the
same: to help the patients attain a greater understanding of the defensive
structure that is shielding their conscious selves from the destructive aspects
of their unconscious rage, and to increase their emotional awareness overall.

If a patient laughs or smiles in reaction to stimuli that clearly call for a
different response, the therapist will draw the patient's attention to that fact
and ask the patient to explain such a nonrational anomaly. Such emotional
incongruities are important clues to clarifying the patient's understanding of
his/her own emotional profile. At each of these points in treatment, therapists
must intercede to increase patients' awareness between underlying emotions and
their ability or failure to express them.

In general, the psychosomatic patients with whom we have worked suffer from
great anxiety and fear. They often feel victimized, and some have, in fact,
often been victims of sexual or physical abuse. Often, as a result of their
histories, many patients are acutely sensitive to the needs of others. They
suffer from low self-regard and are driven to succeed and take care of others.
They have a need to feel in control of situations about which they ultimately
feel totally out of control. This often occurs as a result of feeling that their
own bodies have betrayed them. They frequently have a history of other
psychosomatic disorders. Some have lost a parent or have experienced the
domination of a demanding parent.

Psychosomatic individuals often have a troubled history with other medical
health professionals. They may have been misunderstood due to the fact that
their problems are frequently invisible. 

They have met with significant frustration for themselves as well as the
individuals who have tried unsuccessfully to treat them. As often as not they
have dropped out, removed themselves from normal social contacts, and/or become
more dependent on others, usually family members. The result has been guilt and
lowered self-esteem, which in turn serves to increase their psychosomatic
symptoms. 

When patients are finally able to lose their symptoms, they achieve greater
self-understanding and deal more effectively with others. One of the most
satisfying aspects of a psychotherapist's work is that successful treatment of
the psychosomatic patient results in a healthier emotional as well as healthier
physical individual.

Unconscious anger plays a critical role in the development of back pain.

Severe pain served as a powerful distraction from intolerable and terrifying
feelings of destructive wrath. 

Feelings are unbidden experiences. We have no control over what we feel, but we
can and must exercise control over how we respond to our feelings. The goal of
treatment, then, is to enable the patient to respond to his emotional conflicts
more adaptively -- by means other than developing pain. 

The treatment for psychosomatic pain syndromes does not require that patients
renounce particular feelings but reflect on them.

Whenever she experienced foot pain, she would first ask herself, "What am I
feeling?"

It is, therefore, important to address this issue on an experiential level at
the very outset of treatment. People with TMS need to be able to experience
themselves in the act of repression of an emotion.

This experience allows them to witness firsthand the mindbody at work, such that

They can begin to embrace difficult emotions and facilitate healing. 

The purpose of these symptoms is not to hurt but to distract us and thus to
protect us from experiencing what is unconsciously perceived to be more painful
or unpleasant or what we have come to believe are unacceptable emotions. When
anxiety, fear, anger, rage, shame, guilt, hurt,

Sadness, sorrow, perceived undeserved joy, and the like are overwhelming in
intensity, they penetrate or bypass the common psychological defense mechanisms.
We experience physical symptoms instead of these emotions because the
unconscious mindbody considers them to be less painful, less dangerous or
harmful than the emotions. That may be hard to believe, especially when the pain
is severe, but the severity demonstrates the intensity and power of those
repressed feelings and the fear that they engender in the unconscious.

When a patient can observe him/herself in the act of repressing a given emotion
in a given moment and almost simultaneously begin to experience the emotion
itself, it allows him/her to feel more confident in the mindbody experience,
which in turn facilitates healing

The observing part of the individual can learn to become, as I like to say,
"more comfortable with the discomfort" of what the participating part of the
person is experiencing emotionally. Gradually, the embraced emotion is
experienced not just on an intellectual level but in a full holistic, integrated
way.

In the early stages of therapy it is common to see that when some distressing
emotion begins to surface and threatens to be felt consciously, the unconscious
mindbody may make the pain worse or give the person another symptom to pay
attention to. The therapist's task is to help patients develop and utilize
techniques that will bring them "to their senses," that is, to experience
mindbody integrated as one. When that has been achieved, TMS symptoms are no
longer necessary.

Once the TMS patient feels more comfortable with the experience of this holistic
integration and can begin to embrace once intolerable emotions, we can begin to
do other, more traditional psychotherapeutic work that may be necessary, such as
anger or post-trauma management, or dealing with more subtle issues such as low
self-esteem. All of these play a part in the original personal mindbody
disconnect, which is later reinforced by the culture we live in.

Observe the repression while feeling the anger, the kind of experience that
patients say brings a sense of relief.

Any word, phrase, or grammatical usage that succeeds in protecting the person
from experiencing an uncomfortable or painful unconscious emotion is a buffer.
As with the chuckle, these defenses have to be immediately recognized and gently
brought to the person's attention in order to enhance the ability to observe the
mindbody disconnect and thus embrace a repressed feeling. 

Anger is often frightening for people with TMS to embrace because of either the
fear of losing control (the perfectionist) or significant worry and concern that
the object of the anger will dislike or reject them (the goodist). At other
times, embracing anger can be overwhelming because of the possibility of
profound hurt and sorrow that often underlies the anger. In these cases anger is
like TMS symptoms in that it also protects the person from even more painful
emotions. 

Example of how "good" things in a person's life can precipitate physical
symptoms when there is an underlying conflict.

The anger, at times, is designed to protect the person from these emotions since
they are considered more painful than the anger.

The sorrow which has no vent in tears may make other organs weep.

The ability to embrace sadness, hurt, or sorrow for oneself signifies a letting
go of the self-critical aspect of one's personality and the development of
self-compassion, which is a crucial ingredient for the successful reduction of
psychosomatic symptoms. 

For people with psychosomatic disorders, therapists help them to observe
themselves in the act of repression and become more in touch with emotions like
fear, anxiety, guilt, anger, rage, shame, hurt, sadness, sorrow, perceived
undeserved joy, and so on. At first, these emotions are experienced as
unpleasant, uncomfortable, and, by definition, especially painful. As patients
become more comfortable with the discomfort of embracing these emotions, they
"come to their senses"; that is, they reintegrate mindbody by allowing
themselves to let go of that tight, rigid grip the unconscious mindbody has on
them in the form of physical symptoms. By loosening this grip the mindbody no
longer has to cause other organs to weep. 

Another important therapeutic reality emphasized in the lecture is that the
unconscious will resist change so that one must work on the program
consistently, and be patient.

She had TMS tendonalgia at the left shoulder. It is likely that that was the
cause of the right shoulder pain. 

I diagnose TMS as a physician; I treat it as a teacher. Patients must be
educated and inspired. I tell them, "You have a secret weapon -- your brain. It
may be the instrument of your physical symptoms, but it's also the means by
which those symptoms can be abolished."

Chapter 5: Hypertension and the Mindbody Connection (Samuel J. Mann, M.D.)
---

Are psychological factors a major cause of hypertension? Many people think so,
many others do not. I believe that in some cases there clearly is a mindbody
link, although in most cases there is not. I also believe the mindbody link is
very different from that which most people assume. 

There is no single cause for hypertension, but instead, a mosaic of causes.
Studies show that up to 40 percent of hypertension is determined genetically,
and up to 30 or 40 percent is determined by lifestyle factors such as diet,
weight, salt intake, lack of exercise, and alcohol abuse. I believe that
psychological factors provide an explanation for about 20 to 25 percent of
hypertension.

I hope to show that a new paradigm, which focuses on the emotions we repress and
are unaware of, makes eminent sense and, unlike the old paradigm, can have a
major impact on the treatment of hypertension and of many other conditions that
are also poorly explained by the old paradigm.

The old popular paradigm is that people who tend to be tense or angry, or who
face a lot of day-to-day stress, are at increased risk of developing
hypertension. Four decades of psychosomatic (mindbody) research have sought to
prove this view and to prove that stressreduction techniques can alleviate or
prevent hypertension. They 

Linking hypertension to the emotions we repress. This paradigm requires
recognition of the role of the unconscious and of the important physical effects
of emotions we do not feel or realize we harbor. This understanding can remove
the mystery of the mindbody connection of hypertension and many other disorders
and lead to better treatment approaches.

The first thing I would tell my patients is that worrying is not the cause of
hypertension. The second thing I would tell them is that it is possible they
don't even have hypertension, and if they do, it is probably because of a genetic
predisposition and not because of worrying.

Most people who believe that there is a mindbody connection in hypertension
focus on consciously experienced emotional distress as the link. I do not
believe in this simplistic notion, based on what both the studies and clinical
experience tell me. 

According to this view, if we can learn to handle stress in a better way, we
have a better chance of not becoming hypertensive. If long-standing tension or
anxiety or anger causes repeated blood pressure elevation that ultimately leads
to hypertension, then relaxation techniques and anger management can lower our
blood pressure reaction to stress and prevent hypertension. Thus, we have a
complete loop of cause and prevention or treatment. This is a neat package, with
only one problem. It is very wrong. It is intuitively attractive but wrong, and
decades of studies tell us it is wrong. 

The only point in this old paradigm that holds up in studies is that when we get
angry or anxious, our blood pressure does increase, sometimes substantially.
However, this response is temporary. It doesn't persist. If you get angry at
your spouse, regardless of who is at fault, and regardless of whether you have
hypertension, your blood pressure will likely rise and then come down. This will
happen again and again and again, and has nothing to do with whether you will
ultimately develop hypertension. This is a normal physiologic reaction.

It is also clear that if you run to first base, ride a bicycle, or carry heavy
packages, your blood pressure will increase in the moment. And no, running to
first base does not increase your risk of developing hypertension.

Many people do not realize that it is normal for our blood pressure to fluctuate
and that these fluctuations do not cause damage or lead to disease. I can
guarantee that your blood pressure will be lower if you sit in a chair all day
than if you are active and interact with people. I can also guarantee that
sitting in that chair with a lower blood pressure will not prevent development
of hypertension.

When a concept contains truth, research ultimately hones in on that truth, even
if there are bumps and false starts along the way.

Emotions that we feel clearly can have physical effects, such as a temporary
increase in heart rate or blood pressure, a tension headache, diarrhea, and
other effects. Blood pressure fluctuation in response to stress is simply
another transient physical effect of conscious emotion. It does not lead to
sustained hypertension.

Day-to-day stress does raise our blood pressure in the moment, and it can make
us miserable, but it does not lead to hypertension. 

If a relationship between hypertension and emotions such as anger and anxiety
existed, one would think the evidence would be clear by now. Instead, results
vary tremendously from study to study, offering support for any and every point
of view. 

Studies of anger and hypertension have focused largely on two forms of anger,
"anger-out" and "anger-in." Anger-out is the anger we feel and express. The guy
with a high anger-out score is the type of person who frequently explodes in
anger. Everyone knows he is angry. The studies are clear that this type of
person is not prone to develop hypertension.

The other type of anger, anger-in, might be a different story. Study results are
inconsistent, but they do suggest that people who hold their anger in are
slightly more prone to develop hypertension than people who get it out
(Jorgensen et al., 1996). 

My clinical experience is consistent with what the studies show. I see many
patients who tend to be angry or tense, and I do not find them to be more
hypertension prone than anyone else.

During that year, Susan was upset and angry and frightened and distressed to the
limit. She frequently cried in my office. Yet her blood pressure did not budge a
millimeter during that year.

The transient blood pressure increase seen in response to minor laboratory
stress, which occurs again and again in response to dayto-day stress in real
life, has nothing to do with long-term blood pressure responses to major stress.

Even severe emotional distress does not lead to sustained blood pressure
elevation. This is a statement that flies in the face of what most people
believe, but it is a cornerstone observation that requires us to look for a
different paradigm for the mind/body connection in hypertension. 

But does job stress directly cause hypertension? Here again, my experience and
the results of studies are in agreement that it does not. I see many patients
who are experiencing considerable work stress, for example, long work hours, a
boss who is overly demanding, or other problems. My experience is that it is the
rare patient who experiences a long-term effect on his blood pressure.

As in other areas of psychological research in hypertension, the results are
very inconsistent; in the aggregate, they do not support the contention that job
stress, per se, leads to hypertension

Many studies have attempted to prove that relaxation techniques lower blood
pressure. Again, the results are all over the lot. A major review concluded that
relaxation techniques were of minimal value in treating hypertension

There is no doubt that in the moment the relaxation response, as popularized by
Benson, does lower blood pressure. However, these techniques do not appear to
provide a sustained effect.

It bears repeating that worriers who worry about their blood pressure are not
causing their hypertension.

In my experience, worriers often have "white coat hypertension" rather than true
essential hypertension.

That knowledge can have an immediate and profound effect.

It is not the emotional distress that we feel, but those emotions we have
repressed and are unaware of, that leads to hypertension. The process by which
we unknowingly keep distressful and threatening emotions from awareness causes
persisting stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), resulting in
persisting elevation of blood pressure.

The new paradigm is virtually the opposite of the old. Instead of focusing on
the distressful emotions people feel, it focuses on the tendency to repress
rather than feel painful emotions. The emotions we feel make us miserable and
elevate our blood pressure in the moment but do not have a long-term impact on
our blood pressure. Instead, it is the lack of awareness of distressful emotions
that marks our susceptibility to developing hypertension. 

A key principle of this paradigm is that it is not day-to-day stress that causes
hypertension. It is instead that which has been repressed, which, without
conscious perception or outlet, persists within us for a lifetime, and produces
long-standing rather than transient stimulation of the SNS, leading ultimately
to sustained blood pressure elevation.

The emotions we repress are often much more powerful and painful than the
emotions we consciously experience. These emotions make much better sense as the
link to hypertension both because they are more powerful than the emotions we
experience and because, unlike the emotions we feel, we never rid ourselves of
that which we have repressed. Yet everyone -- from patient to physician to
research psychologist -- focuses on the milder distressful emotions that we feel
and report as the cause of hypertension, without seeing the role of the much
more powerful emotions repressed within us. 

People who tend to experience severe emotional distress in severely stressful
life circumstances are much less likely to develop hypertension than people who
repress the emotion and are not distressed. 

Those who repress emotions related to overwhelming stress or trauma, past or
present, often cope very well because they are not paralyzed by emotional
distress. Repression enables us to move on and function in the aftermath of
severe trauma. However, without sooner or later confronting the emotion
consciously, we are more likely to ultimately suffer psychological consequences
or physical consequence such as hypertension or other poorly understood
psychosomatic conditions.

Many patients have survived psychologically by repressing emotions that would
otherwise have tormented them the rest of their lives. Repression of emotion is
a true blessing to them, but it is contributing to the hypertension.

We are fortunate in having at our disposal both conscious and unconscious
defenses to deal with extremely painful emotions. When we refer to repression,
we are talking about the unconscious, something most people don't even think of
as affecting our blood pressure.

We repress emotions without knowing we are repressing them. This is a simple and
important statement, but one that many people either do not comprehend or do not
believe. Repression does not involve making a conscious effort to put aside
emotional pain. We simply don't feel the pain, essentially a gift from our
unconscious defenses that keep it from our awareness.

Sometimes we repress the pain and don't feel it, and are surprised that we feel
okay, as if nothing had happened, even though we know that we have been deeply
wounded. At other times we feel the pain and make a conscious effort to keep it
out of mind. We keep busy and focus our attention on the tasks at hand to avoid
thinking about our loss. And, of course, there are other times when the pain
scars us. These are the times when we actually are doing the work of healing, by
feeling the pain until it eventually begins to ease and becomes more tolerable.
We are psychologically healthiest when we can use conscious and unconscious
defenses to tamp down emotions that are too much for us, enabling us to
encounter these emotions at a pace we can handle, deal with them, and ultimately
heal.

When handling emotions related to severe trauma, repression is a very valuable
defense for us. I have seen many patients who were survivors of severe abuse or
trauma. Many have suffered psychologically the rest of their lives. Others
escaped those consequences by repressing the emotion, and seem to be doing much
better psychologically than those who did not repress or in whom repression
broke down. Howerver,repression can lead ultimately to health consequences.

In handling emotions related to trauma, conscious and unconscious defenses do
not work in isolation from each other. Even people who have repressed all their
trauma-related emotions have at one time felt deep pain, whether for days or
weeks or longer. In many people, the pain subsides after the conscious handling
of a severely painful emotion, leaving a residue of painful but tolerable
feelings that come up from time to time. In others, trauma-related emotions are
completely repressed and, although the story is remembered, there is no
conscious lingering pain.

We all repress. Aside from trauma, we are bombarded with so much that would
provoke emotional attention that it would be hard to live our lives without
repressing some of it. Then why don't we all have hypertension? Is repression
that is linked to hypertension different than from the repression that everyone
utilizes? In my experience, it is. I see two patterns of repression that seem
related to hypertension: in some, repression is related to a history of
unusually severe abuse or trauma. In others, even without prior abuse or trauma,
repression is overused as the main coping mechanism for handling day-to-day
stress. 

I have seen many patients who have repressed emotions related to prior severe
abuse or trauma, from as long ago as childhood. The fact that the trauma
happened so long ago makes it seem unlikely to patients and doctors that it
could still be having an effect, particularly since the distressful emotions
related to it ceased long ago.

Research psychologists largely ignore what I suspect is an important link
between childhood experience and adult hypertension, focusing instead on
day-to-day anger and anxiety.

Many books have been written about the psychological impact of trauma and how to
treat it. They focus on survivors who are suffering, with little recognition of
the many who have survived without overt psychological consequences such as
depression, anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, alcoholism, drug
abuse, or other problems. These successful survivors have no need to see a
psychologist, which is why psychologists rarely write about them. When such an
individual sees a physician for uncontrollable or severe hypertension, the
physician will not suspect a mindbody link in the absence of overt emotional
pain or psychopathology. The answer lies not in the emotions they report, but in
their story. But the story does not get the attention that it should. 

Repression as a Day-to-Day Coping Style: I see many patients who don't have a
past history of abuse or trauma but who are repressors. We all know people who
are very even keeled, or who are always up, who rarely get upset, even about the
major stuff that gets to most of us.

They routinely repress the distressing emotions of day-to-day life. In my
experience, this tendency is associated with hypertension. This may seem
counterintuitive, but it is what I have observed repeatedly and consistently. It
is saying that someone who never feels depressed, no matter what is going on his
life, is more prone to develop hypertension than someone who does feel depressed
from time to time. 

When I ask a patient if he ever gets depressed or down, a repressor will respond
"never," no matter what problems he has had to endure. He is not holding in
feelings of depression or anxiety or anger. He truly doesn't feel them. 

In his meta-analysis of psychological studies, Jorgensen found emotional
defensiveness, the tendency to be unaware of emotions, to be the psychological
measure most powerfully linked to hypertension

What underlies a person's tendency to handle stress this way? This is not well
understood but clearly is a pattern that is already evident in childhood. It is
not well studied by psychoanalysts since repressors don't tend to go to
psychoanalysts because they are not distressed.

I suspect that, in some instances, a repressive coping style is inborn. 

A repressive coping style might have resulted from growing up in a family that
did not discuss or share feelings or emotional pain, with no one available to
comfort them at times of distress. Instead, without that support, they learned,
by necessity, to numb themselves, to not feel. Some come from a home where the
macho philosophy of not yielding to emotional pain also led to less and less
awareness of painful emotion. Yes, a person can be alone even if surrounded by a
large family. 

Does this mean that being a calm person puts you at risk of developing
hypertension? No. Some people are calm and handle day-to-day stress calmly. They
"don't sweat the small stuff." That approach to stress does not have to involve
repression and is an admirable way to handle the "small stuff." However, when we
don't sweat the big stuff either, when emotions related to the big stuff are
swept under the rug without conscious effort, that is, when the sympathetic
nervous system (SNS) is activated. It is not a bad way to handle overwhelming
stress, but we might ultimately pay a price.

Do all repressors develop hypertension? Certainly not. Many repressors have a
normal blood pressure. What determines whether a repressor develops
hypertension? Two important factors are genetic predisposition and excessive
weight. People with one or both of these risk factors are more likely to develop
hypertension than people without them. These three risk factors -- genetics,
overweight, and a burden of repressed emotions -- appear additive in leading to
hypertension.

Our body has many checks and balances designed to keep our blood pressure within
a normal range. If one system, such as the SNS, is out of whack, other systems
compensate to restore blood pressure to normal. However, if SNS tone is high as
a result of psychological factors, and genetic factors such as abnormal salt
retention are also raising blood pressure, the combination is more likely to
result in abnormally elevated blood pressure. 

Another factor that explains why some people who habitually repress don't
develop hypertension is life experience. People with a repressive coping style
who have encountered unusually severe life stress seem more likely to develop
hypertension than those who haven't. In other words, even if you are a
repressor, if you have been lucky enough to live a life free of unusually severe
stress, you are less likely to develop hypertension than if you have lived a
very difficult life.

I believe emotional factors are a driving force in only a minority of people
with hypertension. As I will describe, identifying those whose hypertension is
psychologically linked is important because different treatment alternatives are
available for them. 

I tend not to suspect psychologically linked hypertension when there are ample
other reasons for someone to have hypertension. For example, if someone is
overweight, has a strong family history (suggestive of genetic predisposition),
and has mild hypertension that responds nicely to a diuretic or an
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), this very ordinary case of
hypertension is highly likely to be related to genetics and lifestyle. On the
other hand, when a patient's personal history suggests repression, or when the
pattern of the hypertension differs from the usual pattern, a psychological link
is much more likely.

Clues to Psychologically Linked Hypertension: 

1. Personal history a. A history of severe abuse or trauma, particularly during
childhood b. The conviction that severe prior trauma has no lingering effects c.
A very even-keeled personality, a person who is never "down"

2. Pattern of the hypertension a. Severe hypertension b. Resistant hypertension
c. Hypertension with a sudden unexplained onset d. Paroxysmal (episodic)
hypertension

I suspect that hypertension might be linked to repressed emotions if an
individual reports a history of severe trauma. In exploring for such trauma, I
always ask about a person's childhood, whether someone had an abusive parent, or
experienced the death of a parent, or other traumatic events. I also inquire
about events in adult life, such as a history of combat or the sudden loss of a
spouse or child.

There are many, many types of trauma, and even when there is a history of severe
trauma, we don't always find it; no brief set of questions can cover all bases.
Nevertheless, particularly in people with severe or uncontrollable hypertension,
such a history can often be uncovered, supporting the link between these forms
of hypertension and psychological antecedents. 

The Conviction That Severe Prior Trauma Has No Lingering Effects: When a patient
reports that prior trauma has had no lingering impact whatsoever, my antennae
are up. This is where I suspect that emotions related to the events have been
walled off and are contributory to the hypertension. If someone has survived
particularly severe trauma without apparent psychological impact, that alone
indicates repression, our greatest ally in moving on. 

A Very Even-Keeled Personality, a Person Who Is Never "Down": The patient who
tells me he is worried about this or angry about that, or that he or she feels
down or depressed from time to time, is not likely to be a repressor. The
patient who tells me he is very even keeled, or is always up, or has never ever
been depressed no matter what has happened, is likely a repressor. 

Pattern of hypertension: In most people, hypertension follows a fairly typical
course. There is usually a family history of hypertension: the hypertension
begins gradually, with borderline readings, or readings that fluctuate between
normal and high until eventually higher readings appear. 

Severe Hypertension: When a patient has severe hypertension, with readings
exceeding 180/110, the diagnosis of plain old essential hypertension is
troubling. It is in these cases that I look for, and often find, clues to a
psychological link. 

Repression does not explain all cases of uncontrolled hypertension, but in my
experience many patients with uncontrollable hypertension have clues suggestive
of repression.

Hypertension with a Sudden Unexplained Onset: When someone has had a
consistently normal blood pressure and suddenly develops severe blood pressure
elevation with no obvious explanation, it is not the usual pattern. The genetic
tendency is not one that affects an individual suddenly. When hypertension
appears in this manner, I search for clues to a mindbody link. 

Paroxysmal Hypertension: In my experience, paroxysmal (episodic) hypertension is
almost always linked to repressed emotions. In this type of hypertension,
patients describe episodes that occur suddenly and out of the blue, consisting
of a sudden onset of physical symptoms such as headache, shortness of breath,
weakness, light-headedness, or sweating, with a sudden increase in blood
pressure that can exceed 200/100.

I have found and reported (Mann, 1999) that almost all people with paroxysmal
hypertension either have a history of unusually severe trauma that they insist
is not affecting them or exhibit a repressive coping style. Understanding this
psychological basis is not merely of academic interest, because it has finally
opened the door to successful treatment. In some cases, a shift in awareness, by
itself, halts recurrence of attacks. 

Psychological factors underlie hypertension in some people but not in others.
When they are operative, the mechanism driving the hypertension differs from the
mechanisms driving more routine cases of essential hypertension. Identification
of psychologically linked hypertension is therefore very important in terms of
selecting treatment that matches the cause of the hypertension.

Diet, exercise, and weight control, and, in many people, restriction of salt
intake are certainly important measures and can eliminate the need for
medication in some and reduce the amount of medication needed in others.

On the other hand, when repression is failing, when internal alarms are going
off without a source that is obvious to us, marked psychological and sometimes
physical symptoms can become apparent. This type of patient appears headed for
unending trouble. Here, psychotherapy can be extremely important, although even
here it comes with no guarantees. 

Is hypnotherapy a worthwhile alternative? Perhaps, although here, as well, we
just don't know whether bringing repressed material to conscious awareness
through hypnotherapy is always safe, particularly in people who are not
suffering psychologically.

The more a trauma survivor insists that the past has had no lingering impact,
indicating that major issues have been repressed, the more likely it is that the
hypertension is related to it, but the less likely it is that such an individual
will be amenable to, or helped by, psychotherapy. 

Blood volume Hypertension that is driven by excessive blood volume is also known
as salt-sensitive hypertension. In genetically susceptible individuals, ingested
salt is less efficiently excreted by the kidneys, leading to retention of sodium
and fluid in the arterial system, and increased calcium ion levels in the smooth
muscle cells of arterial walls, which elevate blood pressure

Salt-sensitive hypertension is particularly common among African-Americans and
in the elderly. Restricting salt intake can normalize blood pressure in some
people with volumerelated hypertension, but for many others drug therapy is
needed.

Sympathetic nervous system: The SNS links the brain to our heart and arterial
system. It has two limbs, the adrenal limb and the sympathetic nerves. The
adrenal limb traverses from the brain, along the spinal cord, to the adrenal
gland, stimulating secretion of adrenaline. Adrenaline, in turn, stimulates
receptors in the heart and arteries, with the most prominent effect being
stimulation of beta receptors in the heart, causing it to beat faster and
harder, and increasing the amount of blood pumped, known as the cardiac output.
When we are nervous and feel our heart racing, that is the adrenaline flowing.
Adrenaline also causes arteries to dilate, through stimulation of beta receptors
in the walls of arteries. 

The neural limb consists of nerves that traverse the spinal cord and innervate
the heart and arterial wall. They stimulate the alpha receptors in the heart and
arterial walls, raising blood pressure by increasing heart contractility and by
narrowing arteries. 

Stimulation of the SNS usually involves activation, to some extent, of both the
adrenal and neural limbs. It is the SNS that mediates the transient effects of
stress and emotion on our blood pressure. Stressors such as fear or anxiety
stimulate primarily the adrenal limb, manifesting with a rapid heart rate and
increased cardiac output and systolic blood pressure. (When blood pressure is
recorded as, for example, 120/80, the 120 is the systolic pressure, which
reflects the pressure generated by the force of the heartbeat, and the 80 is the
diastolic, which reflects the pressure in the arterial system in between
heartbeats.)

Stressors such as weightlifting stimulate mostly the sympathetic limb,
increasing both systolic and diastolic blood pressure, with little effect on
heart rate. Emotional stimuli (e.g., anger and most other stimuli) tend to
stimulate both adrenal and neural limbs.

Hypertension that is driven by the SNS rather than by volume or the RAS is
called neurogenic hypertension.

We do know that the SNS mediates the transient effects of the emotions we feel
on our blood pressure. It is a logical candidate to mediate the effects on blood
pressure of repressed emotions as well. Just as the emotions we feel in the
moment stimulate the SNS and raise blood pressure in the moment, the emotions we
repress chronically stimulate the SNS and produce more long-lasting blood
pressure changes. What is it that triggers the SNS in repressors? Is it the
emotions that fly beneath the surface of conscious awareness? Or is it the
process of repression, the heightened state of alarm unconsciously defending us
against the threat of these emotions? This is unclear. But what seems clear is
that emotional processes we are not consciously aware of are having a more
long-lasting effect on the SNS than are the conscious emotions that distress us. 

Recognition of the role of repressed emotions provides the first valid
explanation for paroxysmal hypertension and the first successful treatment
approach (Mann, 1999). People with paroxysmal hypertension usually don't respond
to ACEIs and diuretics, and need a different approach. The new paradigm offers
three new approaches to treatment, involving drug and nondrug therapies.

One approach offers a cure, involving a shift in awareness of emotions that have
been repressed. If a patient can understand that the disorder is linked to
repressed emotions, and experiences a shift in awareness, the disorder can
literally disappear. 

The patient episodes ceased promptly with this painful realization, without any
psychotherapy. She did, though, have the difficult task of dealing with her
unhappiness. Jill's case demonstrates healing of paroxysmal hypertension brought
about by emotional awareness. However, most people with paroxysmal hypertension
do not experience this shift because of the resistance to awareness of deeply
painful emotions. 

The effectiveness of an antidepressant in this hypertensive disorder is perhaps
the most blatant evidence that the mind can be involved in hypertension, and
that the mind must be considered in assessing patients with difficult-to-control
hypertension.

In looking at the mindbody relationship in hypertension, it is natural to
suspect that the emotions we feel, which clearly do affect our blood pressure in
the moment, play an important role. However, decades of research have failed to
confirm that these emotions lead to hypertension or that techniques to reduce
emotional distress prevent hypertension.

If instead we look at repressed emotions, at the emotions that we don't feel or
complain about or even know we harbor, we have a very different approach that
can finally make sense of the mindbody connection in hypertension, and offer new
approaches to treatment. This understanding identifies the individual who feels
the least emotion as the most hypertension prone, rather than the other way
around. When we realize that the emotions we repress may have more to do with
hypertension and other chronic medical conditions than do the emotions we feel,
we open the door to new approaches to treatment. 

Too many medical conditions remain unexplained, and mindbody research limited to
what the conscious mind reports has failed to help us understand their origin.
Too little attention has been paid to what the conscious mind cannot report. I
hope this will begin to change.

Chapter 6: My Experience with Tension Myositis Syndrome (Ira Rashbaum, M.D.) 
---

There is an almost universal tendency for patients to blame the onset of pain
and other symptoms on some physical activity. 

Over a three-year period the patient had consulted two chiropractors, two
neurologists, two urologists, a gastroenterologist, endocrinologist,
rheumatologist, orthopedist, dermatologist, proctologist, a TMJ
(temporomandibular joint) orthodontist, and an acupuncturist. She had every test
imaginable, with no diagnosis for the pain. One doctor asked her if she enjoyed
going to doctors, and another said he thought she was "faking it." She had
resigned herself to living with pain indefinitely and the fact that she would
probably not be able to have children because she would not be able to live for
nine months without pain medication.

A difficult aspect of practicing mindbody medicine is that the majority of
people with TMS and equivalent disorders cannot accept the diagnosis. This is
particularly frustrating when a successfully treated patient cannot convince
family members of the validity of the diagnosis when they, too, have TMS.
Nonacceptance appears to be the rule.

The Internet and mass media are feeding the epidemic based largely on
misinformation. 

Despite being one of the premier sprinters in the world, Mr. Glickman had been
scratched from the 4 × 100-meter relay event because he was Jewish and the
desire by Avery Brundage (chairman of the U.S. Olympic Committee, whom Glickman
claimed was antisemitic) not to offend Adolf Hitler. Fifty years later, he went
to Berlin for the golden anniversary celebration of Jesse Owens's four gold
medals. In Marty's words: I went down into the well of the stadium and walked
along the backstretch of the track, the portion I should have run so many years
before. I stopped and looked across to the far side where Hilter and his
entourage had watched the games. Fifty feet to the right was the section
reserved for the athletes where I had watched the races. Suddenly a wave of rage
overwhelmed me. I thought I was going to pass out. I began to scream every dirty
curse word, every obscenity I knew. "How could you no-good, dirty, so-and-sos do
this to an eighteen-year-old kid, to any young man who worked so hard to get
there, you rotten SOBs." Slowly, after two or three minutes, I began to calm
down. For forty-nine years, that anger and frustration, that rage had been
inside me. Being there, visualizing and reliving those moments, caused the
eruption which had been gnawing at me for so long and which I thought I had
expunged years ago. It was the only time I'd been back to Berlin's Olympic
Stadium. This Saturday I'll be back there again. I wonder what my reaction will
be. 

The physiology of TMS is relatively unimportant. It is basically a psychological
disorder with physical symptoms. Undoubtedly, the brain could create pain in a
variety of ways, so focusing on the physiology is unnecessarily diverting from
the important question: why does the brain-mind do it?

Chapter 7: A Rheumatologist's experience with Psychosomatic Disorders (Andrea Leonard-Segal, M.D.) 
---

Having the responsibility of teaching someone else is the best way to learn
because the job demands that one master the material completely and crystallize
concepts so as to explain them to someone else.

It was clear that the accepted, "gold standard," diagnoses and treatments were
in fact not based on sound science. In fact, often the logic on which these
therapies were based was flawed (and this has not changed over the last fifteen
years). It was not surprising that patients often did not respond well.

Patients for whom we care are our best teachers; we cannot fool them. When they
do not improve, they are teaching us either that our treatments are ineffective
or that we are making an incorrect diagnosis.

We have made many advances in medicine. We have developed cures and very
effective treatments for many complicated and life-threatening conditions. Why,
then, have we done so poorly curing and treating common, non-life-threatening
problems such as back pain, neck pain, irritable bowel syndrome, and tendon and
ligament pain syndromes, for example? Our failures should tell us that we need
to think "outside the box" about these conditions. We need to review what is
common to patients with these conditions and assess what we may be missing

What do patients with these conditions have in common? Their symptoms are often
triggered by nothing or a very minor physical incident that could be construed
to be normal physical activity. Even though the patient may think he has injured
himself, there is no objective evidence to support this contention. The involved
area is not bruised, bleeding, swollen, red or exceptionally warm to the touch.
The physical complaint does not resolve in a timely way like a true injury; the
pain lingers unlike what would occur with a true injury. Further, the patient
has no physiologic condition that would interfere with the ability to heal
normally and reports that his cuts and bruises heal just fine. A broken bone, a
ruptured tendon, or a postoperative site, for example, would heal within a
couple of months. That is what our bodies are designed to do; they are quite
resilient. But often, a patient who has experienced a true injury that has
healed normally continues to have pain and does not think about the lack of
logic of the continuing pain until it is pointed out to him.

Despite how awful they feel, patients usually have normal physical examinations,
except for tender areas in low back and buttock muscles and restricted movement
in the back, neck, or certain joints in their arm or leg due to the pain.
Patients will often note that those tender spots improve with massage and that
after stretching their mobility improves. 

Blood tests are normal in that they do not show any evidence of inflammation or
chronic disease. They do not suggest a serious, lifethreatening diagnosis. The
changes on x-rays, scans, and other tests often poorly predict the symptoms.
Often, the symptoms are very severe and the diagnostic tests are completely
normal.

Even though the patients look very healthy from the view of the physician, they
feel frail and vulnerable. I often tell my patients that they need to come to
view themselves as I see them, healthy and strong, rather than as they have been
seeing themselves. Patients are often surprised to hear this comment from me.
Generally, I am the last in a long line of doctors they have seen and none has
said anything like this to them before. 

I have observed that the pain often goes away only to appear in a new location.
The physical symptoms seem to jump from one location to another or sometimes
they accumulate, one on top of the other, until everything seems to hurt.

As a matter of fact, for decades the medical literature has been replete with
articles that point to the fact that structure does not predict pain

The cause of the physical discomfort is mostly of questionable structural cause,
though patients feel like something is structurally wrong. The medical
literature attributes up to 85 percent of low back pain as being of unclear
cause.

Patients also share certain physiologic and psychobehavioral aspects. They often
experience physical events that they think triggered their pain episodes. When
explored, there is frequently a relationship between stressful life events or
experiences and the onset of physical symptoms. Many patients describe a sense
of tension and the fact that, in general, there are not too many aspects of
their lives that are "going well." Even though there is no life-threatening
problem or objective measure of illness, people think of themselves as fragile
or unwell. They are obsessed with their symptoms, often aware of their pain or
their body at some level 100 percent of the day. They are terribly fearful. They
are very fearful of "injury" and that they will be permanently disabled. They
are afraid to engage in many normal physical activities, even during periods
when the pain may have abated. They often think that they are easily injured.
Fear drives the way they do or do not engage in physical activities. Some
patients are so afraid that they essentially stop doing everything physical and
are consciously aware of virtually every physical motion they make and how their
body parts are aligned with respect to one another. They feel out of control
because they expect the pain to occur as a consequence of what they do or do not
do. By contrast, this degree of fear and obsession with physical symptoms is not
typical, in my experience, even among patients with serious, deforming arthritic
conditions like gout or rheumatoid arthritis.

How should the medical community determine whether a treatment is effective?

The majority of the conventional treatments for the physical complaints
described here have not been verified by high-quality, doubleblind, randomized,
placebo-controlled, prospective clinical trials, but they should be. This is
called evidence-based medicine. What does this mean? In medicine, we try to
determine whether a drug or a procedure works by comparing it to a placebo
control or, perhaps, another treatment that has been proven to work, an active
control. A placebo treatment can be as a comparison of effectiveness, or a new
treatment could be measured for effectiveness against a standard one. This
necessitates that the study in which the treatment is tested be designed in a
way that will not influence the results and that enough people participate in
the study so the results can be meaningful. The study should be conducted
ethically and with the informed consent of study participants. Ideally, neither
the patient nor the study investigator should know the treatment the patient is
taking during the study so that expectations do not bias the study results. This
is called double-blinding the study. To accomplish this may mean that the
investigator cannot be the person who is actually administering the treatment.
The patients should be allocated to a particular treatment group by an
uncompromised numerical scheme, randomized as to treatment. Clearly defined
objectives should be tested. The patients should all be entered into the study
under the same study conditions and watched carefully from that point forward.
This evidence-based approach should be relatively easily accomplished for the
majority of physical treatment approaches (e.g., physical therapy, injections,
oral medications, acupuncture, and surgery)

Sometimes one well-conducted study may provide convincing information, but it is
always best when more than one study provides confirmatory information. It is
better when a study is conducted by multiple investigators in multiple medical
centers so that enough people can be enrolled to provide statistically and
clinically meaningful information.

Sometimes the number of people enrolled in a study is small, but the study has
redeeming features. If there are other studies looking at the same medical issue
and conducted using the same methods, the data from these studies can be
statistically pooled by a technique called meta-analysis to provide useful
clinical information.

Ironically, the treatments for many of the pain conditions described in this
book, although accepted as "the things to do," have not passed these
evidence-based tests of scientific rigor but, even so, are still prescribed.
Sometimes the studies evaluating whether treatments really work are often flawed
because investigators conduct them in ways that bias the results, or the number
of patients who enroll and participate is very small. So we need to ask
ourselves, "Why do we treat the way we treat?" It is difficult to figure out the
answer to that question if we explore the literature.

It is disturbing to find that despite the dogma that surrounds the treatment of
low back pain, there is little science that supports any particular approach to
treatment. 

What can we learn from the above literature review? Put bluntly, many of the
structurally based treatments that are commonly used for these pain conditions
do not work. Others have not passed the test of scientific rigor, so we do not
know whether they work or not. It is a disconcerting situation, to say the
least, and explains why we have so many patients who suffer repeatedly and for
long periods of time. Why should structurally based treatments be ineffective if
the cause of these pain conditions is structural? Why should it be so difficult
to obtain good clinical information about these treatments? It is not difficult
to design a clinical trial to compare a medication or other treatment modality
to a placebo or to determine if it works to treat pain or cures the underlying
cause. 

What if the cause of the pain is not structural? What if the pain is initiated
by psychological factors? This is an unconventional notion and would explain why
structurally based treatments would not be curative. It certainly makes sense to
consider psychological causation as the basis for the symptoms and signs
discussed in this chapter. Furthermore, structural characteristics are rigid and
fixed. For example, a bone spur does not move, so why does the pain move to a
new place from the site of a bone spur? The severity of the pain is way out of
proportion to the magnitude of the incident to which it is being at attributed.
The sense of fear is disproportionate with the severity of the medical
condition, yet people often feel hopeless. The obsession with the pain is
distracting and makes it difficult for the patient to concentrate on work

How can we study a psychologically based syndrome? Now it is necessary to tackle
a dilemma.

Our own diagnosis of these same conditions -- that they are psychogenic and
should be treated according to the precepts of mindbody medicine -- is not up
against very worthy "opponents." But can we use classical prospective,
placebo-controlled, randomized, blinded methodology to study a psychogenic
problem? How can we apply the standards of evidence-based medicine in this
situation? Is it possible to do better in studying t his approach than has been
done? It is difficult because psychological treatments do not easily lend
themselves to the ideal clinical trial methodology. How can we conduct studies
to see if psychological approaches can cure this condition? Patients with TMS
must be psychologically open to the diagnosis to improve. They must be ready to
renounce the idea that their cure is to be found in structural or chemical
means. Thus, it would be exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, to conduct a
study in which patients with the same condition are randomly assigned to
different treatments, one of which is the TMS treatment. Because getting better
depends on accepting the TMS diagnosis, most patients assigned to TMS treatment
would not improve because they would not be able to accept the diagnosis. 

However, in the case of TMS patients, they can act as their own controls, and
they do. If a patient has suffered for a very long time, has failed with other
treatments, and gets better with an educational program that teaches him/her
about the physical and psychological dimensions of TMS, that's success. Success
is measurable by visual analogue scales and other validated measures of pain and
function. If the pain dissipates and if the patient engages in all physical
activity heretofore shunned out of fear and does not develop recurrent pain,
this is success. If the pain moves from the original location to another during
the course of treatment, this is another confirmation of the diagnosis. If the
patient regains control of his physical body and is no longer afraid, his TMS is
cured. 

No one was able to give him a clear reason for the pain, and the people he saw
approached his symptoms as if each was unrelated to the other. No one addressed
what may have been happening in his life. Because of the anxiety and difficulty
coping, he began seeing a psychologist (a good idea) and began to become aware
of tremendous rage he had harbored toward his wife and his parents. 

It is important to note that there are many other physical disorders that serve
the same psychological purpose as TMS. They are called equivalents of TMS.

There are many other physical complaints that people with this diagnosis can
have that involve essentially every body system. Other than specific tender
points, the physical examination findings will be normal or not particularly
specific and there are no characteristic laboratory tests. Patients generally
have lots of physical complaints but actually look quite healthy to the
clinician.  

The majority of my patients have come from families with hardworking, loving
parents who conveyed overly high expectations and hopes for their children.
These families are not characterized by any particularly unusual dynamics that
would stand out in today's society. Patients with these emotionally induced
physical symptoms are often in the throes of decision making. They may find
themselves in the uncomfortable place of someone who is uncertain of the best
choice to make. The issues holding them back generally have to do with concerns
about disappointing someone, or setting standards too high for themselves.

Often, it is difficult for the patient to see his or her way out of a difficult
situation. Patients often take responsibility too seriously and have forgotten
how to have fun or cannot allow themselves to do so. 

Both patients had grown up in a household where they felt enormous pressure to
succeed, and both had excelled and done just that until life caught up with them
and they had to reevaluate where they were headed.

It is important to recognize that TMS is a symptom of life not going well and
out-of-control circumstances and emotions. It is not surprising that when one
member of a family feels pressures, others do too. The insight that comes from
understanding the basis of physical symptoms that stem from emotions, and the
insight that comes from recognizing the source of the feelings, can ultimately
lead to better family relationships all around. 

The patients I see tend to be very hard on themselves. They take responsibility
too seriously and forget that, as adults, it is also okay to have fun. They have
extraordinary expectations of themselves and of those around them and so are
often disappointed or angered by what they perceive to be their own shortcomings
or those of others. They always try to do their best, not realizing what a hard
job that can be

I often wonder why, in our society, people cannot be "average" anymore. Now in
school, a "C" grade is tantamount to failure. Yet, when it really comes down to
it, we are all average most of the time and can do our best comfortably only
some of the time. Doing our best all the time is exceedingly difficult work and
can lead to frustration and buried anger. My patients are often disappointed if
others do not notice the hard work they have done. Low self-esteem needs to be
fed by compliments from others. 

Getting better from TMS is learning how to extract yourself from needing
recognition from others and learning how to fill that need yourself. It is about
learning to parent yourself in perhaps a kinder, gentler, and more benevolent
way than one may have actually experienced during childhood. It is learning to
lower your expectations of yourself and others and learning that relationships
are easier, more genuine, and form stronger bonds under those circumstances. It
is learning that if someone seems upset with you, the feeling is often displaced
and you are not at fault. It is learning that it is even okay if someone does
get angry with you. It is about learning no to be afraid to take care of
yourself psychologically, to say "no" when you want to and "yes" when you want
to. It is about learning that almost all of the time that you feel guilty, it is
inappropriate, in that you cannot be responsible for taking care of everyone's
feelings. People need to learn to do that for themselves. 

The TMS symptoms come from the psychological conflict that forms in the adult
who sees life through the same eyes that he had as a child, when he had little
or no power or control over life circumstances, and acts accordingly. The
child's view and the behavior that once was a survival technique no longer work.

Sometimes when I give this diagnosis to a patient, the patient misunderstands me
and thinks that I am saying that the pain is not real, that it is all in the
head. This could not be more wrong and I need to clarify things for the patient.
TMS symptoms are physical symptoms, but are generated by a feeling. There are
many things that can cause back pain. Some examples include infection, cancer,
and a fracture from thinning bone. Emotions are another cause.

The mindbody connection has been accepted by some and rejected by others.
Unfortunately, physicians are often among the nonaccepters. It strikes me as
curious that people will readily connect a feeling of embarrassment with red
cheeks or a feeling of nervousness with sweaty hands but are unwilling or unable
to make a con connection between anger and pain. 

It is critically important to human health that we shed our stigma about the
nature of things emotional. Toughing things out, burying uncomfortable feelings,
and living under stress can lead to physical pain and dysfunction and, most
important, serious medical illness.

The beauty of the TMS diagnosis is that it is a hopeful one that can result in a
true cure. The treatment leads to resumption of full physical activity, the
emergence of a more emotionally healthy life, and an education in
self-awareness. The patient who has recovered from TMS grows into a happier,
more comfortable, more peaceful person who sees new paths toward greater
personal fulfillment.

Chapter 8: My Perspective of Psychosomatic Medicine (James R. Rochelle M.D.) 
---

Having surveyed the field of "chronic pain," I became convinced that no one had
any long-term answers. I no longer wanted to refer patients for treatments that
weren't working! I felt strongly that patients were actually being harmed by the
attitude of their physicians. Many patients had become convinced that they had a
"bad back" or a "bad neck.

We are in the midst of an epidemic of pain caused by the psychological issues.

The psychological issues had not been adequately addressed by conventional
medicine because there was no appreciation of the importance of the unconscious.
Dr. Sarno gave primary credit to Freud for emphasizing the importance of the
unconscious in all human behavior.

The pressure to be perfect and to be good is enraging to the unconscious mind. 

Inadequate social history taking must be considered a primary reason that most
doctors do not appreciate the true psychological factors that cause chronic
pain.

There are three sources for unpleasant emotions in the unconscious: childhood
anger, emotional pain, and sadness; personality traits such as perfectionism and
goodism; and the realities of life. 

People get better by developing a conscious awareness of the sources of
unconscious rage and emotional pain. 

Tenderness in the gluteal and lower lumbar region is almost universal in TMS, as
is tenderness at the top of both shoulders. Many patients have paraspinal
tenderness throughout the lumbar spine, extending sometimes into the thoracic
area as well. 

Like most physicians, I had a need to demonstrate that the cause of the pain was
physical. I had simply neglected the fact that these degenerative and bulging
discs seen on the MRI are normal! We all get them as we get older. Even
herniated discs seldom give rise to chronic pain syndromes because the swelling
and inflammation from an acute herniation usually settles down within one to two
weeks. 

The diffuse tenderness that is present in TMS indicates that the central nervous
system, the brain-mind, is involved.

It is anatomically impossible for disk abnormalities to produce tenderness in
the iliotibial band, a tendon, and the gluteal, quadratus lumborum, lumbar
paraspinal, and upper trapezius muscles, as we see in chronic low back pain
caused by TMS. 

Tenderness findings are also important in two areas of interest to an orthopedic
surgeon: the knee and shoulder. Patients often present with a previous diagnosis
of arthritis, chondromalacia patella, torn meniscus, or tendinitis of the knee.
Physical examination findings at the knee will often show tenderness of the
quadriceps tendon, patellar tendon, and the medial and lateral retinaculum
(tendon tissue at the sides of the kneecap). Before I knew about TMS, I had
attributed this tenderness to tendonitis or tendinopathy (a chronic form of
tendinitis). The exact nature of this tendinitis has never been well explained
in the literature. True tendinitis can occur from heavy activity or from
athletic activity. It usually subsides within several days to a couple of weeks.
Yet many patients with chronic knee pain will have distinct areas of tenderness
in the front of the knee from TMS. Since most doctors attribute knee pain to the
more well-recognized conditions above, more and more patients are presenting
with knee pain that is predominantly TMS. Knowledge that TMS is often the
primary source of knee pain allows patients and doctors to avoid expensive,
time-consuming, and often risky treatments. 

My experience with TMS leads me to another conclusion. The typical tenderness in
a number of different tendons is a sign of TMS

Again, an understanding of TMS avoids expensive, risky, and unnecessary
treatment.

There is a strong tendency for pain loci in TMS to move from one place to
another. I used to see patients with back pain for several months. After
resolution of the back pain, I would see them later for shoulder tendinitis and
still later for neck pain. I now realize they were having location substitution.
This is typical of TMS; Dr. Sarno refers to it as the symptom imperative,
meaning that if the psychological need for physical symptoms continues, the
brain will continue to produce them until the psychological situation changes
for the better.

Many people spend a lot of time and money seeing super-specialists for each
different area of the body. They often get the impression that they are falling
apart physically. They are at the point of near exhaustion from all the various
diagnoses and treatments. Many specialists tend to see the patient only in terms
of his herniated disk, his shoulder impingement, or his carpal tunnel syndrome.
There is a woeful trend toward "body parts medicine" that fails to see people as
individuals. A patient is simply a collection of body parts to many of today's
specialists. Patients receive a diagnostic label and receive treatment according
to an "evidence-based model." This cookbook approach to treatment may serve the
interests of the managed care bureaucracy, but it drives a wedge between patient
and doctor. There is very little appreciation of the whole person and no
understanding of the mindbody connection.

An excellent tool for understanding the whole person is to have the patient
complete a pain diagram. I ask them to shade in all the areas of the body where
they feel pain or have had pain in the last year. Many people with TMS shade in
a fairly large portion of the pain diagram. They have had pain in a number of
different locations in the preceding months. I have pain diagrams over several
years on many patients. The change that occurs over time makes a compelling case
for the tendency for location substitution that occurs in TMS.

Reassurance is powerful medicine. People can stop worrying that their next
attack of severe neck pain is just around the comer. They will realize that they
don't have a permanently "bad back." They can work to reverse the powerful
negative conditioning the medical establishment has foisted on them over the
years. They can rediscover faith and hope in the future. 

It's really a question of diagnosis. That's the heart of the matter, Dr. Sarno
has stated. The TMS diagnosis is liberating and empowering for patients. It
gives chronic pain sufferers their best opportunity to live a full and rewarding
life, free of pain. 

It takes courage to look at issues that many people would prefer to avoid.

The major issue in their life has ceased to be their chronic pain problem, but
rather some stressor or emotional issue they are dealing with in psychotherapy.

Chapter 9: Structural Pain or Psychosomatic Pain? (Douglas Hoffman M.D.) 
---

One week my back pain was better than it had been in ten years and in six weeks
I was "cured." I was stunned! Simply by understanding my pain as psychosomatic,
including its psychological reasons, and "undoing" all the ways in which I was
programmed to have back pain, I was pain free!

Many of the common musculoskeletal disorders are not well explained by our
conventional teaching and are frequently psychosomatic in origin.

Medicine teaches us that pain, particularly musculoskeletal pain, is a
consequence of an abnormality of a particular structure. This is most easily
illustrated and accepted with acute trauma. When one falls on an outstretched
hand and sustains a wrist fracture, the resulting structural abnormality causes
pain. When the bone heals, the pain goes away. Similarly, when a track sprinter
sustains an acute tear to his hamstring muscle, it hurts. There is usually
swelling and bleeding as a result of the tear. But as the muscle begins to heal,
the pain subsides and the athlete is back sprinting again once the healing and
rehabilitation are complete. This understanding as the origin of pain, however,
is generally applied to all musculoskeletal pain syndromes. For example, after a
hit-from-behind car accident people assume that muscles and other soft tissues
have been damaged (whiplash syndrome). Other common examples are leg pain,
referred to as sciatica and routinely attributed by doctors and patients to
compression by a lumbar herniated disc; low back pain blamed on normal aging
changes of discs and spinal bones; and carpal tunnel syndrome. 

The term inflammation is commonly used to explain pain despite the fact that
there is no scientific proof that it exists. A persistently painful muscle or
tendon is often said to be inflamed or strained. Pain on the bottom of the foot
(plantar fasciitis), elbow pain (tennis elbow), shoulder pain (impingement), and
hip pain (trochanteric bursitis) are common examples of psychosomatic tendon
pain attributed to some structural abnormality (inflamed, torn, worn, strained,
degenerated). I refer to this as the structural model. Though there are some
conditions that can be explained by this model, a careful study of common
nontraumatic pain complaints reveals that most are not structurally induced.
However, structural abnormalities are almost universally accepted as the cause
of most musculoskeletal pain, while psychological factors are thought to have
little or no role in the pain, except to make it worse or better. To modify the
pain is one thing, but the overwhelming majority of doctors and patients do not
believe that the mind can actually cause a physical disorder, which is the
definition of psychosomatic. 

In the course of my work I have been greatly impressed with the common
misperceptions about the definition of a psychosomatic disorder. Grossly
mistaken ideas, like "the pain is in your head," or "it's imaginary," or "the
person is a hypochondriac (or mentally unsound)," are universal. Even physicians
are guilty of harboring such opinions. If one considers the disorder that caused
my back pain, TMS, and all its equivalents (stomach, colon, allergic,
dermatologic, etc.), the fact that we experience them when we're nervous, when
we're sad or glad or sexually aroused, it is clear that psychosomatic reactions
are universal, normal, and part of the human condition.

It is not unusual to develop a viral illness (the common cold) during a time of
emotional stress, the result of weakening of the immune system. We are talking
about physiologic changes that occur in various tissues or organs in the body
that are induced by emotions. That is the meaning of psychosomatic.

Another thing that has impressed me is the almost universal lack of awareness in
medicine where psychosomatic disorders are concerned that if you don't treat the
cause of a symptom you cannot expect a cure. The nonsurgical treatment of pain
is almost totally symptomatic. Pain clinics treat pain, sometimes relieving the
pain thanks to a placebo reaction (cure through blind faith), but in most cases
the pain returns, and so the pain epidemics continue. 

Surgeons believe they are treating the cause when they perform surgery for
herniated discs, spinal stenosis, malalignments, and the like; but since these
abnormalities are usually not the cause of the pain, surgery will either fail or
the patient may have a placebo cure. This possible surgical outcome was
described in the medical literature by a Harvard professor forty-four years ago.
Surgery is a powerful placebo.

Placebo cures (surgical or nonsurgical) are poor medicine because they do not
treat the cause. If the results were permanent, we could live with that, but
they are not. If the pain is relieved, one of three things will happen: either
it will come back, the brain will locate the pain somewhere else, or the brain
will choose another organ or system to produce symptoms. Sometimes it will
substitute an emotional reaction such as anxiety or depression. I have referred
to this as the equivalency response. This extremely important phenomenon has
been described by Dr. Sarno as the symptom imperative. It means that you must
eliminate a symptom by treating the cause, or the brain will simply find another
symptom.

Because neither patients nor doctors recognize the reality of psychosomatic
pain, they are under the impression that pain is always caused by
structural-physical phenomena. The occurrence of physical incidents associated
with the onset of pain reinforces for patients the idea that they have hurt
themselves or that the continuation of pain after a legitimate injury (like the
man with the broken ankle mentioned earlier) is still due to the injury. I have
seen countless patients who fall into this category. These people are not
malingerers. They are unaware that the injury served as a trigger, setting off
the TMS response. They truly believe that the original injury is responsible for
their chronic pain.

The psychosomatic response (TMS where pain is concerned) may begin slowly and
insidiously or at the time of a physical trigger. The latter may be something as
mundane as swinging a golf club or lifting a laundry basket or following a
legitimate injury.

From an epidemiologic perspective, physical triggers are central in shaping the
nature of psychosomatic disorders. The unconscious mind strives to present
symptoms that are legitimized in society. It wants to be taken seriously!
Therefore, a pain disorder arising from a physical trigger serves to legitimize
the psychosomatic one. Thus, as the nature of structural illness changes over
time and between cultures, so does psychogenic illness.

On a more individual level, physical triggers are one of the most common
catalysts of the psychosomatic process. Automobile accidents, falls, physical
abuse, and repetitive motion in the workplace are examples of physical triggers
that often result in chronic pain syndromes.

One would expect to have a bruised and sore back for one to two weeks from a
fall, not a chronic pain syndrome.

This awareness of a disorder, as I mentioned above, is a strong trigger to
developing a psychosomatic disorder. 

Similarly, when societal influences are altered or eliminated, then the
psychosomatic process will subsequently change. 

Physical abuse is another dramatic example of how a physical stimulus often
results in a chronic pain syndrome of psychogenic origin. It is not unusual for
a contusion or fracture as a result of physical abuse to result in chronic pain
despite apparent healing from objective criteria. This is an example of a
physical trigger interacting with an emotional one to produce a psychosomatic
disorder. 

Societal influences are numerous and quite powerful in shaping the psychosomatic
process, not only for a given individual but also for a society as a whole.
Culturally, we are a society that promotes and rewards those individuals who
blunt their emotions. Being "cool, calm, and collected" is a positive value in
our culture. Parents often tell a child who is feeling pain, whether physical or
emotional, that "everything is okay" or "you'll be all right" rather than hug
them and allow them to express their distress and thereby validate what they are
feeling. Our society is emotionally well defended. However, the difference
between how we think we should feel about a situation or event in our lives (our
conscious emotion) and what we really feel (often the unconscious emotion)
becomes psychogenic. 

When a patient says to me "I'm not going to let it (stress) get to me," red
flags go up. It is not uncommon for a patient who chooses to treat their
physical disorder through Dr. Sarno's methods to begin to experience life in a
more genuine way -- in other words, to become more aware of emotions as they
really occur. However, many individuals would find living life in a more genuine
manner more difficult than the physical pain they are experiencing because they
would have to acknowledge painful parts of themselves or painful emotions buried
deep inside their unconscious mind. Theoretically, in a society that encourages
and supports expressing emotions, there would be less of a need for the
psychosomatic process to supersede. 

A lucrative industry has developed in search of the quick fix to chronic pain.
Unfortunately, patients will experience only a temporary improvement (or an
equivalency reaction) with these "placebo" devices.

The health care industry plays a big role in validating and perpetuating
psychosomatic disorders. As I mentioned earlier, medical school training and,
therefore, medical practice does not understand or acknowledge psychosomatic
disorders. Thus, physicians can only explain pain based on the structural model.
This has several important implications. First, treatment strategies can only be
derived from this model. Second, validating one's psychosomatic pain disorder as
a structural problem reinforces the reason the pain is there in the first place,
to distract one's unconscious emotions. Thus, current medical treatments often
reinforce the psychosomatic process because they legitimize and validate the
pain as structural.

If physicians did not validate psychosomatic problems as structural (e.g., f
ibromyalgia), then the problem would diminish, or even disappear. 

Emotional triggers occur when circumstances, whether dramatic or more subtle,
evoke unconscious painful emotions and fuel the need to defend them with a
distraction such as physical pain. In other words, real stress is that which
evokes unconscious emotions. Life cycle events such as marriage, having
children, moving, aging, and growing older are often strong emotional triggers.

A forty-four-year-old male physician was getting dressed for his daily morning
run. He anticipated a shorter run that particular morning since this was his
first day in a new faculty position and he wanted to arrive early. Upon bending
down to tie his shoe he developed sharp, intense pain in his lower back. He was
able to go to work, but his pain did not subside for several days. Six months
later he still had aching in his low back and had not returned to running for
fear it would worsen again. This physician had bent down to tie his shoe
thousands of times without difficulty. What was different this time? He was
experiencing emotional stress in anticipation of his first day at a new job. Not
just the conscious stress of starting a new job but the unconscious emotions
that were probably evoked, such as feelings of fear and insecurity.

A controlling parent can be enraging to a child, which is one of a number of
painful unconscious emotions that this patient has been protecting, natural
tendency to avoid emotions can signal an unconscious fear that if she allows her
repressed emotions to go unprotected, they may come pouring out uncontrollably.

This can also be enraging, especially for an individual who has learned that if
you work hard enough, your rewards will come. So, with the building of life
stresses and the loss of distractions, the back pain saved the day and kept
those emotions repressed.

The important role that pain plays in distracting one's mind away from the
emotional to the physical. I find that there are other pain equivalents that
serve as distractions, one of the most common being the workaholic ethic. I can
remember a coworker telling me, "Why would I ever want to take a vacation; I
wouldn't know what to do with myself!" In other words, unconsciously he is
saying, "Why would I ever want to sit with my emotions?" It would be too painful
for him!

In my practice one of the most common life events that may trigger the
psychosomatic process is the process of aging. Aging often encompasses such
issues as failing health, loss of independence, and the realities of mortality
-- both in oneself and in loved ones. The evaluation of these patients is
challenging since the incidence of other structural diagnoses such as cancer,
organ failure, neurologic, and rheumatologic disorders is higher in the elderly
population. 

Painful unconscious emotions fuel the psychosomatic process!

There is no question that unconscious emotions are the foundation of the
psychosomatic process. It has been my experience that any painful unconscious
emotion can be psychogenic since it can be threatening to us and thus we
naturally want to defend against it. Anger or rage is a common emotion that
warrants our defenses but usually is a response to repressed emotions such as
shame, guilt, feeling unwanted or inadequate, sorrow, fear, and insecurity. 

The body generates TMS pain to adequately defend against the threat of
expressing one's own unconscious emotions.

Patients who were physically, emotionally, or sexually abused often experience a
lifetime of physical pain rather than having to grieve and experience the
unbearable emotional pain that became repressed in childhood from their awful
experience. This is an example of the symptom imperative: the need to have
physical symptoms, often and ongoing, in order to keep one's emotions repressed
and well defended. To emphasize again, I have found that the severity and
chronicity of one's symptoms is proportional to the underlying pain that harbors
in the unconscious and the triggers that evoke them.

It is common for patients or physicians who understand the true cause and thus
the appropriate treatment of psychosomatic disorders to want to tell their
friends or acquaintances about their disorder and how to successfully treat it.
They are often met with resistance.

If one acknowledges that his disorder is psychogenic, then he is acknowledging
those painful unconscious emotions. He is shedding his defenses and, thus, his
distractions. Consequently, he would begin to feel emotional pain! For many,
this would be too much. It would be easier to have their physical pain than to
begin to feel those emotions that have been repressed for good reason. Of
course, this thought process is not conscious.

It's not easy to acknowledge that these powerful and painful emotions reside
within us. That's why they have been repressed.

She was able to flip the switch between having back pain or struggling with her
emotions. In the end, it was easier to have back pain!

We should not forget the power of these emotions. For many, it is easier to
suffer with physical pain than it is to acknowledge the emotional ones.
Furthermore, our society is not supportive of expressing those painful emotions
we all harbor. As I noted before, we are a society that is uncomfortable with
crying or grieving, and view those who become overtaken with emotion as weak.
It's no wonder we often feel alone with our emotions and desire to keep them
repressed. There is often no support to help grieve life's disappointments,
challenges, and losses that we all experience as human beings.

Physical Examination:

* Presence of muscle trigger points 

* Hypersensitivity to palpation of soft tissue 

* Neurologic dysfunction (paresthesias, weakness) in a nonanatomic distribution 

* Exaggerated response to pain 

Not one of the signs or symptoms listed above is individually specific for a
psychosomatic disorder. Rather, one must place them in context with the
presenting problem as well as consideration of other structural disorders that
may also explain the presenting complaints.

There are many instances in which I believe there is a spectrum between the
psychosomatic and structural as the source of pain. For example, a disorder such
as fibromyalgia is clearly psychosomatic in origin. In contrast, pain from a
wrist fracture is due to a structural abnormality. Take a common disorder such
as osteoarthritis of the knee, for example. Degenerative changes revealed by
radiographs of the knee may certainly account for pain. However, it is common
for me to see severe degenerative changes on x-rays in joints that are
completely pain free! Therefore, I understand the pain as an interaction
somewhere along the spectrum between the physical and the psychosomatic. In
other words, the osteoarthritis that shows up on the x-ray may trigger the
psychosomatic process, which could transform an otherwise asymptomatic or
minimally painful joint into a painful one or intensifying the pain beyond what
would be expected for that condition. 

Many of the common disorders that are thought of as structural in origin have a
significant psychosomatic component. 

Acceptance and understanding are the foundation for successful treatment of a
psychosomatic disorder.

I have observed that there are several common questions patients express with
regard to the treatment of psychosomatic disorders. Foremost is the question of
how to "figure out" their stresses and make the necessary changes. This question
reflects their understanding that life is too stressful and therefore they must
eliminate stress in order for the pain to go away. Of course, this thought
process is not correct. First, psychosomatic disorders arise from the
unconscious mind, which is where emotions reside that, for the most part, we are
unaware of. Not only is it not possible to directly access these emotions, but
it is not necessary for successful treatment for most individuals. Successful
treatment requires one to simply acknowledge that these painful, unpleasant,
often threatening emotions exist. It is not necessary to "figure them out."
Treatment is about acknowledging their existence, not changing them. Stress is
unavoidable and a part of life. Acceptance, then, not only means accepting one's
pain as psychosomatic, but also coming to terms with our genuine self, both the
parts we like about ourselves and the parts we don't like. Accepting our painful
unconscious emotions as part of who we are is not only a step toward successful
treatment but a step toward being a more whole human being.

Another common question patients ask me is whether they should stop their
rehabilitation exercises, or going to the chiropractor, or their lumbar support,
and so on. The answer is yes! The cause of a psychosomatic disorder, and
therefore the cure, resides in the mind. Patients become programmed very quickly
by well-intentioned advice from various health care providers. For example, when
a patient with low back pain is undergoing physical therapy and the therapist
advises good posture, proper lifting techniques, and avoidance of potential
aggravating activities, the patient becomes programmed to potentially have pain
if the advice is not fulfilled. Who has good posture all the time? Successful
treatment, therefore, includes identifying the ways in which the patient has
been programmed and to confront and overcome them.

I have found that treatment failures often stem from the continuation of the
intense programming that occurs as an inevitable part of their prior treatments.
Tied into this programming is what I call the fear factor.Patients become quite
fearful that if they do something wrong, such as bending over without keeping
their back straight, they will have pain or do more damage. Of course, the pain
from a psychosomatic disorder is harmless (not to minimize the intensity of the
pain). Once patients accept this, they can confront the ways that they are
programmed and overcome them. 

The universal nature of psychosomatic disorders and the common occurrence of the
symptom imperative, or the need to keep those painful unconscious emotions
repressed.

Many patients with psychosomatic disorders like it when doctors tell them they
are damaged goods. It validates their symptom imperative. However, when we
doctors do this, we become part of the problem and reinforce the psychosomatic
process.

Knowledge of the psychosoma tic process has also given me the ability to treat
conditions that are thought of as incurable, such as fibromyalgia. 

Textbooks state that fibromyalgia is of unknown cause and is not curable. I've
cured patients with fibromyalgia. They are the patients who are willing to look
at their problem as a psychosomatic disorder.

Chapter 10: A Family Doctor's Experience with Mindbody Medicine (Marc Sopher, M.D.) 
---

Family doctors provide comprehensive care of their patients -- they treat the
whole person. I am responsible for not only evaluating and treating signs and
symptoms of illness and disease, but also helping to keep my patients well. I
help my patients of all ages to get well when they are ailing and to stay well.
Like most family doctors, I am usually the first person my patients seek out to
evaluate their symptoms and examine them. The ability to recognize a
psychosomatic process when it begins is of great practical value since it spares
patients unnecessary and inappropriate treatment, which is usually unsuccessful,
and only prolongs their discomfort and disability. Timely, accurate diagnosis
and treatment speeds the resolution of symptoms and restores the quality of
life, which is our ultimate intention. 

Not all pain is due to TMS. However, I do believe that the majority of chronic
and recurrent pain does not have a structural-physical basis, but a
psychological-physical one.

Treating a psychologically caused symptom with a physical modality is bound to
fail.

Differential diagnosis -- the process by which the physician obtains information
from the patient (the history), does an appropriate physical examination (the
physical), orders diagnostic studies (blood tests, x-rays, MRI, etc.), and then
interprets this amassed data to produce a list of diagnoses that more or less
correlate with the accumulated data. This list is known as the differential
diagnosis. One of these is chosen as the most likely diagnosis and appropriate
treatment is instituted. This is the art and science of clinical medicine --
selecting the proper diagnosis and treatment.

One of the major problems in the contemporary diagnostic practices of pain
disorders is that physicians often do not have a differential diagnosis.

Those of us who practice psychosomatic medicine are chided for our lack of
"scientific evidence" for the existence of such entities as TMS, but neither do
the critics have any evidence for their diagnostic conclusions. They speak of
compression and inflammation, but there is not one whit of evidence in the
medical literature that supports their diagnostic ideas, despite which they
blithely proceed with surgical and other treatments.

Inappropriate treatment based on erroneous diagnoses is almost the rule where
musculoskeletal disorders are concerned. The result is that patients continue to
have symptoms, may have temporary relief due to the placebo phenomenon,
sometimes develop symptoms in a different location, or even in a different
system (gastrointestinal, dermatologic, etc.). This is the symptom imperative

Why are physicians so reluctant to embrace TMS theory? For one thing, it is
difficult to measure. The scientific approach mandates that any treatment be
evaluated by formal testing, involving control groups, "blind" evaluations,
"double blind" protocols, and the like. Too often, TMS physicians are dismissed
by colleagues who state that the TMS treatment results are "anecdotal." The
implication is that our results are invalid because we do not employ a
scientific protocol. Unfortunately, a control study would be impossible because
therapeutic success in the treatment of TMS requires that patients accept the
fact that their symptoms have a psychological basis. If patients cannot
repudiate the structural explanation for their pain (a disk problem, a heel
spur, carpal tunnel syndrome, etc.) and attribute the pain instead to TMS, they
cannot get better. In a control study, patients are assigned randomly to two or
more treatment methods. If most of the patients assigned to TMS treatment cannot
accept the diagnosis for reasons to be discussed, the study is invalid. The
nature of TMS puts us at great disadvantage in such studies.

In addition to being difficult to measure with traditional scientific protocols,
it is extremely time consuming to treat TMS. It is much simpler to prescribe a
pill or recommend physical therapy or surgery than to explain to someone how his
very real physical symptoms can have a psychological cause. If this concept is
entirely new to patients, they are likely to be very disappointed. More often
than not, they were hoping for a "quick fix" -- some physical treatment that
would quickly alleviate their pain. Based on their conditioning and experience,
this is often the expectation. Upon hearing that it is likely that their
symptoms have a psychological cause, many believe they are being told their
symptoms are not real, that they are imaginary. Worse yet, they may believe they
are being told that they are hypochondriacs, that they are "crazy," or that it
is "all in their head." This can strain even the best doctor-patient
relationship. Much time must be spent carefully explaining how psychology can
and does affect physiology. It is so much easier to write a prescription! 

As a society, we are becoming so passive that we wish to be only recipients of
treatment as opposed to active participants in our health and wellness.

We are sentient beings. We have the capacity for thought and emotions. This is
what makes us capable of the most extraordinary achievements -- works of art,
scientific discoveries, literature, technology, and so on. It is also our
downfall. Thinking and feeling allow us to experience both positive and negative
emotions. We all seek joy and happiness, but reality intercedes and we all
experience sadness and disappointment, anger and frustration. The ability to
comprehend the concept of a future carries with it the somewhat less charming
sensation of worrying about that future. 

Life is stressful. Even if we are happy and feel good about our families, jobs,
and finances, we all experience stress. Stress, anger, and conflict arise from
three main sources. There are, first of all, the everyday issues such as our
home and work responsibilities, worry about our children, worrying about our
parents, inconsiderate drivers, the long line at the market, and the like.
Second, some of us have experienced much emotional distress in childhood. Even
if we have made peace with it, that distress is still there, a potential source
of unpleasant feelings. Third, our own personalities also predispose us to these
troubling emotions. If we have high expectations for ourselves, if we are
ambitious and place great demands on ourselves, if we are very conscientious
about our performance, then these perfectionist traits are causes of stress. If
we go out of our way to help and care for others, even to the point of
self-sacrifice, then these "goodist" traits also create stress as we make our
needs subordinate to those around us. 

These personality traits are not undesirable -- they make us successful, kind,
and considerate. But it is essential to understand how these very qualities can
contribute to the accumulation of stress, anger, and conflict. The way our
brains work, we repress unpleasant thoughts and emotions, which then find a home
in the unconscious. This is a very good defense mechanism -- it allows us to
move on and take care of our responsibilities and be nice people that others
like and respect. Unfortunately, we can only hold so many of these unpleasant
thoughts and emotions in the unconscious. Accumulated anger, stress, and
conflict become rage. This rage wants to rise to consciousness, but we usually
do not let this happen. If it were to happen, we might rant and rave and do
things that would not be acceptable, things that would make others not think
well of us. To distract us from these unpleasant thoughts and emotions, our
brain creates pain, real physical pain. In our society it is acceptable, even
"in vogue," to have certain symptoms, such as back pain, headaches, and acid
reflux. When we focus on our pain, we are distracted from these causes of rage.
This is a brilliant strategy on the part of the brain. Why does this occur? No
one can know for sure, but we know this happens because by learning about it, we
can stop it. We can stop it and thereby eliminate the pain. 

Dr. Sarno has identified three potential sources for this rage in the
unconscious. In each person the quantity from each source will vary. 1. Stresses
and strains of daily life 2. The residue of anger from infancy and childhood 3.
Internal conflict (self-imposed pressure -- the clash of the id and the
superego; it also comes from perfectionist and goodist traits) 

Unpleasant thoughts and emotions may be pushed into the unconscious, as they
would be difficult to bear. If we attempted to deal with them, it is possible
that we would somehow become incapacitated in one of two ways. First, the id
could take over, in which case angry, belligerent behavior would occur. In my
lectures I refer to a ranting, raving lunatic, someone in need of a
straitjacket. But behaving like that is not acceptable, so we push those
thoughts away rather than act inappropriately and be ostracized (causing further
reduction in self-esteem). Second, we could become paralyzed with grief, unable
to function in the face of unpleasantness. But we don't want that either,
because then we'd be shirking our responsibilities. 

Repressing (unconsciously) or suppressing (consciously) thoughts and emotions
that are unpleasant, disagreeable, or unacceptable allows us to carry on, but
adds to the reservoir of rage. These unpleasant thoughts and emotions "strive to
rise to consciousness," which would be completely unacceptable. To prevent this
from happening, the brain creates pain as a distraction. As a society, we are
very somatically focused, preoccupied with every ache or pain. By focusing our
attention on physical symptoms, we keep these painful thoughts and emotions
repressed. This is a very effective strategy, and as evidence of that fact there
is an absolute epidemic of mindbody disorders in our society. 

Because full understanding of these points is crucial for symptom resolution, I
then reiterate: TMS is a strategy of the brain to keep unpleasant thoughts and
emotions from rising from the unconscious into the conscious mind. The brain,
through established physiologic pathways, creates pain as a distraction. By
focusing our attention on physical symptoms, we keep these painful thoughts and
emotions repressed. This is a very effective strategy, as there is an absolute
epidemic of mindbody disorders in our society 

Is it really as simple as getting patients to learn how to think differently?
The answer is yes, but with the understanding that the mental work involved may
be considerable.

We are conditioned to hold certain beliefs about ourselves -- prejudices -- as a
result of the explanations and comments of well-meaning health care providers,
family, friends, neighbors, coworkers, and the media. Repeatedly, we hear that
physical symptoms must have a physical cause, that we are inherently fragile and
susceptible to injury, that certain "injuries" can result in chronic pain, that
healing can take a very long time, that we have to learn to live with certain
kinds of pain. If we believe in these assumptions, which I refer to as myths in
my book, then we come to expect and accept certain kinds of pain as a result of
our activities. Thinking differently requires reprogramming the mind, enacting
new modes of thought -- new conditioning to replace the old conditioning.

Strategies of TMS Treatment: Make a List, think of anything that could be a
source of stress for you. Think about what makes you angry or enraged. Think of
what things you worry about. Think about your personality. Identify
perfectionist and/or goodist traits. Are there people in your life who did not
treat you as well as you would have liked? Write all of this down. It is
impossible to know what is in your unconscious (hence the name unconscious), but
it is possible to contemplate what might be there. By acknowledging the presence
of these unpleasant thoughts and emotions, you can thwart the brain's strategy.
As you undoubtedly recall, the brain's strategy is to create pain, pain that
will serve as a distraction. Focusing on the pain is a type of defense mechanism
-- it keeps us from thinking about those things that make us upset, worried, or
angry. The pain keeps the reservoir of rage hidden. When we recognize that it is
there and what it may contain, there is no need for the pain, because there is
no further need for distraction.

Making a list is like keeping a journal. Many studies have shown that those who
write regularly in a journal, about themselves, their thoughts and concerns, are
healthier than those who do not. So, start your list or a journal, and add to it
or review it regularly. 

Reflect: by now, you have figured out that it is the process of self-education
that will help you to feel better. It is amazing -- no medication, no physical
remedies, and no side effects. Set aside time each day to think about TMS theory
and treatment. Read and reread my book and Dr. Sarno's books. It's not necessary
to reread everything, but it will be helpful to reread passages that you find
particularly pertinent. Even when you feel well, spend some time each day on
this material. This will help you to remain well. It is good preventive
medicine.

Discard Your Physical Remedies Get rid of the special back supports, heel pads,
orthotics, pillows, chair cushions, and so on. They cannot fix the problem, and
you don't need them. Physical modalities cannot help symptoms that have a
psychological cause. Their very existence is part of the old conditioning and
will only perpetuate the symptoms. 

Be Eternally Vigilant: Eternal vigilance is the proverbial "ounce of
prevention." This is why it is necessary to spend some time each day reflecting.
Celebrate the good days. This is essential to reversing the old condition. Tell
yourself you are indeed fine -- if you had a physical problem, where did it go?
However, do not be discouraged if pain returns or occurs at another location.
Remember, your brain does not want to give up its strategy of distracting you
with pain -- this is how we are made. 

Resume Activity: You are not really well until you are back doing the activities
you formerly enjoyed. While you may have to start slowly (it is still necessary
to follow appropriate guidelines for exercise training), you should be able to
do whatever you want. We are capable of far more than we have been told. I think
very few of us approach our potential because we have been misinformed about the
limits of our bodies. I have patients in their sixties, seventies, and eighties
running marathons, bicycling across the country, climbing mountains, and
participating in other strenuous activities.

Accurate thinking means understanding how psychological factors affect our
physiology. Only when we understand this can we truly heal ourselves. 

It's not easy forgetting all that you have been told and, in essence, creating a
new belief system. As a matter of fact, it is extremely difficult. There are
many obstacles, both within and without. Many people speak to me about fear.
Invariably, each has undergone a comprehensive evaluation by their physician (or
multiple physicians). They may have been told they have one of the diagnoses
that I have mentioned here. Very possibly, they have been told that they must
avoid certain activities or they will risk further damage or escalation of
symptoms. For many, this can be devastating, particularly if they have been
advised to give up or curtail an activity that has brought them much pleasure.

Fear is powerful, and it is part of the conditioning that has occurred over
time. It takes courage to put aside the fear. Whenever someone confronts their
fear, resumes their activity, and feels fine, I tell them to celebrate.
CELEBRATE! I tell them to talk to their brain -- tell themselves that they are
fine! There cannot be a physical problem if they were able to do the activity
without difficulty. Celebrating is an important way to reprogram the mind. It
helps condition you to think differently about your body and will help you
immeasurably to undo the old conditioning and forget all that came before. 

On the flip side, it is important not to be discouraged if symptoms arise during
the course of an activity. It simply means that more mental work must be done.
It is easy for fear and its gloomy companion doubt to creep in. "Maybe it isn't
TMS, maybe I do have a physical problem" is a common thought. The best advice is
to simply acknowledge this fear as part of the old conditioning, to recognize
that it is simply an aspect of the brain's strategy to have you believe there is
a physical problem.

A common question I hear daily is "What should I do when I have pain, especially
a lot of pain?" It can be very difficult to ignore pain and carry on. First, you
must talk to your brain and remind yourself that you are physically fine. Tell
your brain that you are onto its game, that you know about the reservoir of
rage. Like Dorothy discovering the Wizard of Oz behind the curtain, you won't be
fooled! The pain is not present because you've done something that you are
incapable of or that you are so feeble or fragile.

Remember, the brain wants to distract you and keep your attention and focus on
pain, rather than on what may be in the unconscious.

Try to remain active, doing the activities that you enjoy. 

Dr. Sopher -- My name is Paul Teta. I recently (two weeks ago) had an
appointment with you. I came with my brother, whom you were nice enough to
invite to the seminar. I just wanted to give you a quick update on my progress.
The day I arrived for my initial exam I was in pain and also on a strong
painkiller, and had been for weeks. I had read Dr. Sarno's book twice. After you
confirmed that I had TMS, you said to not to fear the pain for it was harmless
and my back was normal. I think that statement saved me weeks of time. That
evening we went to the seminar, which gave me even more confidence. I have not
taken any medicine of any kind for back pain. Several days after, I put on my
roller blades and bladed about ten miles. At that point my leg was killing me. I
continued to blade for another eight miles and my back started to twist and I
was losing the lumbar curve. I kept repeating to myself, "The pain is harmless
and my back is normal." At about nineteen miles the pain stopped and my leg
turned warm. Afterward, I had a twentymile drive home. I had no pain sitting for
the first time. While driving home I started to scream out loud, "I'm sick of
this pain dictating my life!" I began to cry and did so for about thirty minutes
(possibly childhood rage?). After that I have taken out my running shoes (after
fifteen years) and resumed running. "NO PAIN." I feel eighteen again. I also can
bend over and can for the first time put on my socks without lying down. In my
wildest dreams, I never expected to do this well. Twenty years of fear and pain
erased so quickly. I have since purchased about ten books and have given them to
friends and customers of mine. Thank you, dr. Sopher.

The need for eternal vigilance. Thinking about TMS, even when we are well,
serves as preventive medicine. Those who are able to do this find they can nip
in the bud many aches and pains. When this occurs it is extremely empowering, as
we recognize the control we have over our bodies. This also helps to solidify
the new belief systems about how psychology affects our physical being. 

Ultimately, I am confident that TMS theory will become part of mainstream
medicine for the simple reason that it is correct and is more successful at
alleviating pain than any other modality. As more and more people are helped
with this approach, physicians will be forced to take notice. Besides, knowing
how awesome and complex the brain is, doesn't it seem rather short-sighted to
discount the role that the brain can play with regard to bodily sensations?
